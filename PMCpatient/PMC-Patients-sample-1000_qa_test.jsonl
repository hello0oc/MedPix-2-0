Results of the physical examination on admission indicated no icteric sclera. The abdomen was soft with no palpable abdominal mass. The patient had experienced a weight loss of about five kg in the past two months and had no history of hepatitis B or C. She had been exposed to dogs and sheep and denied any history of exposure to infected cases from the epidemic area. After admission, CA19-9 was measured and was 796.20 U/mL. No serological examination for echinococcosis was performed because of the limited conditions of our hospital. Test results from pelvic ultrasound indicated menopausal uterus and uterine fibroids. Test results from gastroscopy showed chronic non atrophic gastritis. Colonoscopy revealed multiple polyps in the large intestine (basically removed); intestinal histopathology (cecum, biopsy) showed severe chronic inflammation of the mucosa and adenomatous hyperplasia of the individual glands. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the upper abdomen (Fig. A) revealed a more homogeneous thickening of the gastric wall in the antrum. Round unenhanced low-density foci with a diameter of 4.6 cm was seen in the S7 segment of the liver. Nodular calcifications were also observed. No significant dilatation was noted in the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts. The size and shape of the gallbladder were normal, the wall was not thick, and no significant abnormal density was observed in the cavity. The pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands showed no significant abnormalities. Test results from computed tomography indicated liver cyst and intrahepatic calcifications. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the liver and gallbladder (Fig. B, ) revealed a normal size and shape of the liver and proportion of each lobe, and the intrahepatic and extrahepatic bile ducts and flow vessels ran naturally. A long T1 and long T2 cystic signal with a diameter of about 4.7 cm was observed in the right lobe of the liver, with liquid level, short T1 high signal intensity in the lower layer, high signal intensity on diffusion-weighted imaging sequence, and enhancement of the cyst wall on the enhanced scan.

There was a scaphoid abdomen with maximal tenderness in the right upper quadrant. There was significant guarding. Bowel sounds were audible. His abdominal X-ray and routine blood test results were both unremarkable, other than a raised C-reactive protein of 92.\\nHis high opioid requirement, chronicity of symptoms, and examination findings prompted further evaluation with CT. This revealed right-sided abdominal mass and a layering effect at the caecal pole consistent with an intussusception. The appearance was similar to a “pseudokidney,” as shown in . There was marked free fluid within the abdominal cavity. After resuscitation, he proceeded to a laparotomy.\\nA diagnostic laparotomy was performed for the inspection of abdominal contents. It confirmed radiological findings of an intussusception of the terminal ileum within the caecal pole. A hard mass was noted within the hepatic flexure region.

{"uid": "6029170-1", "pmid": "29970121", "title": "Surgical repair of massive dilatation of the right atrium with tricuspid regurgitation", "patient": "A 76-year-old woman had an 8-year history of atrial fibrillation (AF) and severe TR. Her history included mild hypothyroidism and right upper lobectomy for lung carcinoma 11 years previously. For 2 years, she had complained of shortness of breath when lying in the left lateral decubitus position. She had felt dyspnea after mild exercise for 9 months. Recently, she had a sense of abdominal fullness. Although administration of diuretics was started, her symptoms did not completely improve, and she was referred to our department for surgical treatment. The follow-up chest X-ray showed a gradually protruding right-side shadow of the cardiac silhouette, and the cardiothoracic ratio on the chest X-ray reached 88% (Fig. ). The electrocardiogram showed AF with low fibrillatory wave amplitude. Echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricular (RV) cavity and mild paradoxical motion of the ventricular septum. The tricuspid valve had no findings of an organic and constructive abnormality, with no severe tethering. The annular size of the tricuspid valve was 50 mm, and the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion was 21 mm (Table ). Repeated preoperative cardiac catheterization showed slightly elevated wedge pressure with mild pulmonary hypertension, although LV function was preserved with a cardiac index of 4.0 (Table ). There was no L-R shunt disease. Computed tomography (CT) findings showed that the maximum size of the RA reached 121 mm (Fig. ). The change in dimension of the RA by CT showed that the size of the RA increased with time (Fig. ). Blood tests showed no liver dysfunction.\\nSurgery was performed via median sternotomy. The pericardium was extremely thin on the RA side without any defect. There was no adherence in the pericardial cavity. Cardiopulmonary bypass was established by ascending aorta cannulation with bicaval drainage.

Although showing depressive symptoms, according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (5th ed., DSM-V) [], the latter could not be classified as a major episode of depression (MDD). She had suffered a circumscribed ischemic stroke two years earlier, which had left her with incomplete Broca’s aphasia and dysprosody. By “incomplete” we mean two things here: (i) the fact that the severity of the speech impairment fluctuated over time, leaving the patient with better abilities on some days and worse on others, and (ii) the fact that the patient always retained some capability to express very simple words and phrases. However, due to the patient’s refusal to undergo testing with psychometric scales, we were unable to assess the severity of this deficit through the use of more objective means, such as battery scores.\\nThe examining physicians, becoming aware of the specific symptoms, retrospectively examined her file (after the consent of the patient and later of her husband), which contained all the clinical, laboratory, and imaging elements that had been collected.\\nThe patient had no family or personal history of psychiatric diseases, nor SI/SB, prior to the onset of her language impairments. Her only other somatic complaint was hypertension. Her family was very supportive and consisted of a husband, three children, and several grand-children. The patient was bilingual in Italian and French and had been working as a writer and translator.\\nAfter hospitalization in a psychiatric unit, a cerebral MRI was performed, revealing a diffuse white matter high-signal hyper-intensity in the left posteroinferior portion of the frontal lobe, just anterior to motor cortex. Small white matter high-signal hyper-intensities were also located in the frontal lobe of the right hemisphere. A neuropsychological investigation was not possible because of the patient’s refusal.\\nThe patient was started on psychotropic treatment with the antidepressant sertraline (increasing the dose gradually to 50 mg/day) and, with an anxiolytic purpose, quetiapine (12.5 mg × 3 per day), a drug that with higher posology is mainly prescribed to treat bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. She was treated by a multidisciplinary team of psychiatrists, neurologists, psychologists, and speech therapists. Although the patient showed gradual improvements, both with regard to the anxious and depressive symptomatologies, we observed marked deteriorations in her psychiatric (increased anxiety and depressive symptoms) and neurological patterns (greater difficulty in finding words and more incongruent prosody) whenever she was asked to describe her situation and emotions to the best of her abilities. We also observed a marked improvement in her language expression abilities once her anxiety and depressive symptoms were controlled. The patient described feeling powerless after the onset of her language deficit, which, having been a professional a professional in the field of language, represented an immense and burdensome impairment for her, eventually leading to her SI and SA. The multidisciplinary team worked to offer her other means of expression besides language, and to mobilize her emotions by employing a range of approaches (art therapy, music therapy, psychomotricity, garden therapy, and pet therapy). Therapists attempted to elicit the activation and expression of complex emotional responses by showing her photographs, both generic and of the patient’s family, by engaging the patient in small “role-playing games” that were interesting to the patient, and by encouraging her to use words in songs that she had memorized during her youth, and to which she was emotionally and affectively linked.\\nWhile SI was fluctuant initially, after 6 months the patient no longer had any SI and showed an overall improvement. She was therefore discharged and referred to an outpatient facility where she continued treatment for about one year. Then, stating that she was feeling much better, the patient decided to no longer continue her treatment and also wanted to stop attending any sessions with both psychiatrist and speech therapists, contrary to medical advice at the time. Soon after, her anxious and depressive symptoms reappeared, her language expression deteriorated, and, 6 months after stopping her outpatient treatment, the patient performed suicide by drowning in a lake.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1.

The CT scan was interpreted by a radiology resident 15 minutes later and final interpretation by a board-certified emergency radiologist was completed in an additional 1 hour and 25 minutes.

He had arterial hypertension and diabetes mellitus under good pharmacological control. He also had microcythemia due to a thalassemic trait. The atrial fibrillation was discovered seven years earlier with an electrocardiogram performed during a routine medical examination. The patient was asymptomatic for palpitations, irregular heartbeat, or other cardiological symptoms. An echocardiogram was performed without showing any pathological feature and oral anticoagulation with Dabigatran (CHA2DS2-VASC score 2) was started. After four weeks of therapy, electrical cardioversion was performed with effectiveness in restoring sinus rhythm. An antiarrhythmic therapy with Flecainide 100 mg twice daily was also initiated. The patient did not undergo further medical checks during the following five years, when, during a cardiological visit, the recurrence of the arrhythmia was discovered. The patient mentioned reduction in daily normal activity due to asthenia. An echocardiography exam showed a left atrial indexed volume of 36 mL/m2 and a left ventricular ejection fraction of 47%. AF ablation through PVI was proposed. At admission, the electrocardiogram showed AF. To perform an accurate anatomical reconstruction of the right and left atrium and a high-density voltage map, the multi-electrode mapping (MEM) catheter Pentaray™ (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) was used. As in the previous case, we started by mapping the right atrium to define the inferior and superior vena cava, the His location, and the coronary sinus (A). Next, a decapolar catheter was inserted in the coronary sinus under 3D EAM guidance. Again, we mapped the FO looking for fragmented and low-voltage signals. However, this time, using the Pentaray™ catheter, we were able to achieve a higher signal resolution and to easily discriminate between a low-voltage and fragmented signal area, although the patient was in AF. Moreover, using the Pentaray™ catheter, we were able to acquire a detailed map in a shorter time (5 min with Pentaray™ catheter vs. 10 min with Thermocool SmartTouch™ SF catheter in the previous case).

To perform an accurate anatomical reconstruction of the right and left atrium and a high-density voltage map, the multi-electrode mapping (MEM) catheter Pentaray™ (Biosense Webster, Johnson & Johnson Medical S.p.a., Irvine, CA, USA) was used. As in the previous case, we started by mapping the right atrium to define the inferior and superior vena cava, the His location, and the coronary sinus (A). Next, a decapolar catheter was inserted in the coronary sinus under 3D EAM guidance. Again, we mapped the FO looking for fragmented and low-voltage signals. However, this time, using the Pentaray™ catheter, we were able to achieve a higher signal resolution and to easily discriminate between a low-voltage and fragmented signal area, although the patient was in AF. Moreover, using the Pentaray™ catheter, we were able to acquire a detailed map in a shorter time (5 min with Pentaray™ catheter vs. 10 min with Thermocool SmartTouch™ SF catheter in the previous case). Again, based on the 3D EAM and under ICE guidance, a single transseptal puncture was performed with the VIZIGO™ sheath and the transseptal needle, both visible on the 3D EAM system (B,C). The transseptal puncture procedure followed the same steps already described in the previous case (video of the puncture is available in the ). The Pentaray™ catheter was then advanced in the left atrium through the VIZIGO™ sheath and a detailed fast anatomical mapping of the chamber and the veins was obtained (). The VIZIGO™ steerable sheath was extremely useful to map all the left atrium structures and veins very quickly. Moreover, using ICE imaging and the CartoSound® module, we could identify important structures, such as the pulmonary veins (A) and the esophagus (B), and to co-register the ultrasound images with the fast anatomical map obtained with CARTO 3®. The Pentaray™ catheter was then replaced by the ThermoCool SmartTouch™ SF catheter to perform PVI following the CLOSE protocol []. Again, with the help of the VIZIGO™ steerable sheath, we performed ablations with good contact and stability, leading to a fast and effective PVI. As in the previous case, the entire procedure was performed without fluoroscopy and without complications (procedural time was 110 min, radiofrequency time was 19 min, and fluoroscopy time was 00:00 min:s). The patient was followed up 3 months after the procedure with an outpatient visit, echocardiogram, and electrocardiographic-Holter monitoring, which did not register any AF episode. The echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction (65%) and the patient mentioned that there was not a reduction in normal daily activities. After 6 months follow-up, the patient is taking low dose of flecainide (50 mg twice per day), apixaban 5 mg twice per day and has not recurrences of AF.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1.

{"uid": "8686580-1", "pmid": "34930268", "title": "X-linked sideroblastic anaemia in a female fetus: a case report and a literature review", "patient": "A 36-year old woman was referred to a tertiary unit at 29+5 weeks of gestation due to fetal cardiomegaly and mild ascites (Fig. a, b), which was detected on a scan undertaken for suspected small for gestational age. The woman was nulliparous with a low-risk first trimester combined screening test and unremarkable anomaly scan. She was rhesus B negative and underwent non-invasive prenatal testing that determined the rhesus genotype of the fetus to be rhesus B negative. Otherwise, no red blood cell antibodies were reported. Of note, the maternal grandmother was known to have sideroblastic anaemia that was diagnosed at 17 years of age. The mother of the unborn fetus and her brother had undergone testing as children but were told that no further follow-up was needed. Unfortunately, additional information regarding and genetic testing for this family history was not available. The woman had mild macrocytic anaemia with haemoglobin of 10.4 g/dl and a mean corpuscular volume of 104 fl. The woman had not received any preconceptional or genetic counselling.\\nUpon arrival, the first scan in our department demonstrated a middle cerebral arterial (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) value above 1.5 Multiples of the Median (MoM). Fetal biometry was normal, as was the amniotic fluid index and umbilical artery doppler. Dexamethasone for fetal lung maturation was administered, and an uncomplicated in utero fetal blood transfusion (IUT) was performed at 30+3 weeks of gestation. The pre-transfusion fetal haemoglobin was 4.4 g/dl, which was increased to 14.1 g/dl following 120 mL of blood transfusion through the intrahepatic portion of the umbilical vein (Fig. ). Investigations to determine the underlying cause of fetal anaemia included microarray comparative genomic hybridization, serology to exclude congenital infection, a peripheral blood film and fetal bilirubin to detect haemolysis. These preliminary investigations were normal. A fetal MRI brain was performed, which showed no abnormalities. In the subsequent weeks, the MCA-PSV improved, as did the cardiomegaly.\\nAt 35+3 weeks of gestation, the MCA-PSV increased to above 1.5 MoM. The options of delivery and ex-utero transfusion versus IUT were discussed with the multidisciplinary team and with parents. As it was considered that an IUT would allow pregnancy to proceed to term, it was decided to proceed with IUT. A second IUT took place with a pre-and post-transfusion fetal haemoglobin of 9.7 and 15 g/dl, respectively. The MCA-PSV remained stable until 37 weeks and three days when a caesarean section for breech presentation was planned.

Transvaginal ultrasound revealed a 10-cm multi-lobular cystic pelvic mass containing the mixed heterogeneous solid component, fluid and papillary growth in the inner surface of cystic wall Significant venous flow was detected in the solid part and papillary growth lesion. Serum AFP (< 20 ng/ml), cancer antigen (CA)-125 (< 35 U/ml), and carcinoembryonic antigen (< 5 ng/ml), and CA19–9 (< 37 U/ml) were 60,721, 38.1, 84, and 97 ng/ml, respectively. All of these tumor markers from serum have their own specific cut off values and sensitivities, and they come from the same assay methods and from the same laboratory. All are elevated. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 9-cm heterogenous mass probably developed from the left adnexa (Fig. ) and a 4-cm well-defined mass located at the right subphrenic region (Fig. ), suggesting the diagnosis of left ovarian carcinoma with peritoneal seeding.\\nThe patient underwent optimal debulking surgery, including total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, pelvic lymphadenectomy, and para-aortic lymphadenectomy (Fig. ). All gross tumors were almost completely resected. Histologically, sections of the left ovarian tumor showed a clear cell carcinoma (Fig. ). The tumor is composed of polygonal, cuboidal to columnar cells with clear cytoplasm arranged in solid nests and tubule-cystic growth patterns. Numerous hyaline globules are present. Some tumor cells also showed high-grade anaplastic nuclear features. Right ovarian tumor showed metastatic clear cell carcinoma (Fig. ). Typical yolk sac tumor differentiation and Shiller-Duval body were absent. Sal-like protein 4 (SALL4) was strongly positive (Fig. ). Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells were positive for glypican-3 (GPC3) and AFP and negative for CD30. Meanwhile, the tumor cells showed weak positive staining for hepatocyte nuclear factor1-beta (HNF-1beta) (Fig. ). The tumor cells were focally positive for cytokeratin (CK) 20 and Cdx2 (caudal type homeobox 2) and negative for CK7 (Fig. ). To rule out potential artifacts due to antibody issues, we titrated the antibody used for AFP staining (Fig. ). For every immunohistochemical stain, positive controls were included. As a negative control, we also stained the classical clear cell carcinoma (Fig. ). Combination of all made a diagnosis of AFP-producing clear cell type EOC with fetal gut differentiation, FIGO (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics) IIIc.\\nAfter surgery, the patient received adjuvant multi-agent chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel). After treatment, CT showed a 2-cm hypodense nodule at the right subphrenic region and wedge-shaped hypoperfusion over segment 7 of the liver, suspicious tumor seeding, and liver metastasis (Fig. ) and serum level of AFP was 1831 ng/ml. Tumor excision for liver metastasis was done. Dose-intensity chemotherapy with weekly paclitaxel was given. CT scan, 1 year later, showed a lobulated mixed solid and cystic lesion at the right paracolic gutter measuring 5 cm in size in favor of peritoneal seeding (Fig. ). Exploratory laparotomy was done, including the use of Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator. After operation, chemotherapy was given through intraperitoneal route. After additional 18 months, tumor recurrence was found, including persistent liver metastases (Fig. ), with increasing serum level of AFP of 330,014 ng/ml.

His parents explained that fever began three days ago and rashes developed after one day. The rashes started with mild itching in the feet, spreading to the thighs and the genital area on the second day. Despite taking antihistamines, the fever and rashes continued on the third day. The patient presented to the hospital with fever, malaise, poor feeding, mucosal involvement of the mouth, lips, conjunctiva, and maculopapular rashes, which resulted in ulcer and bulla formation (). On arrival, he had the following vital signs. Temperature: 39.5°C, blood pressure = 82/10 mmHg, respiratory rate = 28, and pulse rate = 86. The patient's clinical course, blistered skin lesions, and mucosal involvement led to the primary diagnosis of SJS/TEN. Reviewing his medical history revealed that ranitidine was the only medication he had used in the past three weeks. Moreover, his mother had a history of upper respiratory infection (URI) three weeks ago, which was accompanied by low-grade fever and resolved in three days. The patient received supportive care, steroids, and intravenous immune globin (IVIG) based on the primary diagnosis of SJS/TEN.

These included waking up early, being nervous and afraid for no apparent reason, and being fearful of leaving the house. The patient was upset, sensitive, and cried occasionally. In addition, the patient needed walking support (e.g., hands on the wall) at home to prevent falling. The patient had been hospitalized at a local mental health center 2 months prior to the present admission, where she was diagnosed with “GAD.” She received paroxetine (20 mg/d), tandospirone (30 mg/d), and oxazepam (15 mg/d). Her symptoms improved, and so she was discharged. She reported that she took the medications regularly according to the instructions. However, half a month prior to admission at our hospital, the patient experienced a relapse characterized by anxiety, fear, small steps while walking, reluctance to come out of her home, speaking less, and being slow to respond, as well as urinary incontinence. In addition, her social skills declined significantly, and the patient could not take care of herself independently. The patient had been diagnosed with type-II diabetes 4 years previously. No other comorbidities were reported. The patient had no abnormalities in her personal history, menstrual history, marriage and childbirth history, or family history.\\nPhysical examination after admission revealed she had normal limb muscle strength and tone. The finger-to-nose, rapid alternating movement, heel-to-shin tests, and Romberg’s sign were normal. However, her gait was not stable and she took small steps. She was negative for pathological signs and meningeal irritation. In a psychological assessment, the patient exhibited clear consciousness, disorientation to place and time, passivity during interactions with few answers to questions, no hallucinations or delusions, a decline in memory and cognition; and a reduction in daily physical activities and energy levels.

Movement and laying supine exacerbated the pain, whereas some relief was found with paracetamol. There was no trauma to the area, but the patient reported playing netball shortly before the pain started. There was no associated nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel or urinary habit. There was no fever and no symptoms of cough or breathing difficulties.\\nThe patient had no significant medical history and immunisations were up to date. On examination, she was apyrexial with a heart rate of 110 beats per minute, oxygen saturations of 99% on room air and respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. She was warm and well perfused with a central capillary refill time of <2 seconds. She appeared distressed when laying down reporting worsening pain; however, the abdomen was soft and non-tender to palpation. Systemic examination was otherwise unremarkable.\\nUrine analysis showed no evidence of infection and blood tests revealed a C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23 mg/L and a normal full blood count with white cells of 13.4 × 109 cells/L. Liver function tests, urea and electrolytes, and venous blood gas were also normal.\\nWith normal observations, examination and investigation results and a good response to analgesia in the department, the patient was discharged with a planned review.\\nOn re-assessment the following day, she continued to complain of significant pain on the right side of the abdomen with similar features on examination. Owing to the persistence of symptoms, chest radiography (Fig. ) and abdominal ultrasound were performed. Both were reported as normal. With no surgical or medical cause of the pain identified, it was deemed musculoskeletal in origin, associated with playing netball. She was discharged with advice to take regular analgesia and to return if symptoms were not settling.\\nThe patient represented the following day looking unwell. She appeared very pale with dry lips and walked slowly, hunched over. She was tachycardic at 130 beats per minute and tachypnoeic with a respiratory rate of 32 breaths per minute. Oxygen saturations, temperature, and blood pressure were normal at 98%, 36.80C, and 119/72 mmHg respectively. She stood with her right hip and knee slightly flexed, with her trunk deviated to the left giving her a marked scoliosis. Musculoskeletal examination of the spine, hips, and knees was unremarkable, but it was noted that abdominal pain worsened on flexion of the hip against resistance. Cardiovascular and respiratory examinations were normal. She was unable to lie supine because of severe pain and was examined in the semirecumbent position. Active distension of the abdomen and coughing further exacerbated the pain and she was found to have guarding with rebound tenderness in the right flank and hypochondrium. An intravenous cannula was inserted and intravenous fluids, paracetamol, and ibuprofen were commenced while awaiting a surgical review for her acute abdomen. Concurrent orthopedic opinion was also sought because of the new-onset scoliosis.\\nAfter treatment the patients’ pain was significantly reduced, pallor had resolved and her observations normalised. Abdominal examination at the time of surgical review was normal, but because of repeated presentations with abdominal pain and a rising CRP (93 mg/L) and white cell count (13.9 × 109 cells/L) the patient was admitted and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis was arranged. Orthopedic review did not yield any acute orthopedic concerns regarding the scoliosis and they agreed with the plan for abdominal imaging. The CT scan failed to reveal an abdominal cause for her pain, but to our surprise showed an organizing right lower lobe pneumonia with a small effusion (Figs. and ).\\nThe patient was started on intravenous antibiotics for the thus far silent pneumonia. Despite treatment during the next few days, the pneumonia progressed and she developed a large parapneumonic effusion (Figs. and ). On the 6th day of hospital admission, she deteriorated rapidly with signs of sepsis and respiratory distress. This was accompanied by a further rise in CRP (351 mg/L) and white cell count (17.3 × 109 cells/L). She was stabilized and then transferred to a tertiary hospital for further management.\\nAt the tertiary center, a chest drain was inserted and the patient was treated with intrapleural urokinase therapy and intravenous antibiotics.

Mantle cell lymphoma with multiple lymphomatous polyposis had been diagnosed based on a bone marrow biopsy. The patient received three cycles of R-Maxi CHOP and three cycles of R-High Dose-Ara-C (Nordic protocol\\n) with complete response on the CT scan. His peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) were mobilized and harvested on his last cycle of R-High Dose Ara-C with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and plerixafor. Seven months after his diagnosis and two months after his last chemoimmunotherapy, he underwent the BeEAM protocol for an autologous HCT, which consists of bendamustine 200 mg/m2 intravenously given on days –8 and –7, cytarabine 200 mg/m2 intravenously twice a day on days –6 to –3, etoposide 100 mg/m2 intravenously twice a day on days –6 to –3, and melphalan 140 mg/m2 intravenously on day –2.\\n He was only taking vitamin D supplements at the time.\\nBaseline laboratory workup was unremarkable, as shown in . On day –8, he began the BeEAM protocol and received his first dose of intravenous bendamustine 440 mg (200 mg/m2). He also received intravenous fluids as part of the BeEAM protocol. From day –6, his urine output, serum sodium and serum creatinine started to increase (). His urine output markedly increased from 3725 mL on day –8 to 7425 mL on day –3 and the serum creatinine increased from 75 µmol/L on day –7 to 155 µmol/L on day –3. His serum sodium also increased to a peak of 155 mmol/L on day –2. During this time, the patient only complained of mild nausea. Vital signs were stable. Forced diuresis with furosemide was suspended and oral hydration was optimized.\\nOn day –1, the patient started complaining of polyuria, nocturia and thirst. However, he could not drink, since he had severe mucositis and odynophagia due to his chemotherapy, which led him to be put on total parenteral nutrition a few days after. A nephrology consultation request was made. Laboratory studies revealed the following values: random urine sodium 56 mmol/L; random urine osmolality 307 mOsm/kg and specific urine gravity from urinalysis 1.006. Despite the normal range of urine osmolality, the nephrologist team suspected a nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI) along with concomitant dehydration in absence of other identified causes of polyuria. However, no water deprivation test or desmopressin challenge was done since the patient had developed an acute kidney injury (AKI), and required fluids for his hypernatremia and his upcoming HCT. After the HCT, the patient’s infusion was first switched to 0.45% sodium chloride and subsequently to dextrose 5%. Serum sodium levels showed little improvement while fluid balance improved but remained negative. On day 5, desmopressin 1 mcg was administered subcutaneously with no effect on diuresis. The following day, a desmopressin (4 mcg) challenge was administered intravenously and showed a 33% increase from baseline urine osmolality of 204 mOsm/kg to an average of 277 mOsm/kg with a decrease in diuresis. These values were compatible with a diagnosis of diabetes insipidus. The patient remained polyuric and highly dependent on fluids due to his hypernatremia. Since he was partially responsive to the desmopressin challenge, intranasal desmopressin was started on day 8. The dose was increased until it reached desmopressin 40 mcg twice daily intranasally on day 11 (). A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was then performed on day 12 to rule out central lymphomatous infiltrates, which came back negative and therefore reinforced a diagnosis of partial NDI. On day 13, his natremia returned to normal range along with diuresis decreased to 600-800 cc/8 h, intravenous dextrose 5% was stopped. Desmopressin was weaned off and then stopped on day 15. By then, the patient’s nocturia had markedly improved and NDI was considered resolved. On day 18, the patient was discharged from the hospital.

She had severe class III malocclusion and facial deformity, which included nasal and mandibular deviation to the right. After taking a comprehensive medical and dental history, we noticed that the patient had hypodontia with several impacted teeth due to amelogenesis imperfecta (Figure ).\\nIntra-oral clinical examination revealed horizontal discrepancy of alveolar ridge, knife-edge mandibular alveolar ridge, uneven alveolar ridge, and a deep palate (Figure ).\\nRoutine radiographic examinations consisting of panoramic radiography and lateral cephalometry were requested. The cephalogram exhibited anterior-posterior discrepancy of the jaw in the horizontal plane and a pseudo-long face.\\nFollowing consultation with a prosthodontist, cosmetic surgery was scheduled for the patient to correct her long face, mid-face deficiency, jaw deviation to the right, class III discrepancy, and alveolar ridge deficiency followed by dental implant placement and full mouth prosthetic rehabilitation. After consultation with an orthodontist, it was found that forced eruption of the impacted teeth was not possible; thus, the teeth were extracted under local anesthesia.\\nPrimary impressions were made using irreversible hydrocolloid impression material (Kimica, Tokyo, Japan). Special trays were fabricated, and final impression was made by zinc oxide eugenol (Wuhan Xingzhengshun, Hubei, China). Then, the occlusal rims were made to record the inter-arch relationship, and the casts were mounted in a semi-adjustable articulator (Dentatus, New York, USA) in centric relation. The teeth were arranged in class III occlusion, and then they were coated with barium sulfate (Foshan Xinmei Chemical, Guangdong, China) to make them opaque for easy detection of the occlusal line for Epker cephalometric prediction tracing (Figure ).\\nThe Epker prediction tracing was performed for preoperative assessments, which included analysis of the maxillary retrognathism, mandibular prognathism, and excess skeletal vertical growth. Sagittal split ramus osteotomy and LeFort I osteotomy were scheduled. According to the data obtained from the lateral cephalogram of the patient and clinical examinations (zygomatic regions, paranasal area, nasolabial, and gonial angles, SNA, SNB, and ANB angles), the surgeon planned a mandibular setback procedure by 7 mm and repositioning of the maxilla by 2 mm superiorly and 5 mm anteriorly on surgical casts. Then, the casts were mounted in this new position and the jaw relations were determined. Posterior teeth were arranged in new articulation and the final dentures were fabricated. The surgeon used these dentures for the edentulous patient as the final surgical splint. Mandibular cast and denture setback by 7 mm relative to its current position and an intermediate stent was fabricated using auto-polymerizing acrylic resin (Kulzer, Newbury, UK). Then, dentures were fabricated as splint and after polishing, several holes were drilled in the base of denture, and the arch bar was bonded to it. Circummandibular wires for the mandible and palatal screws were used to fix the splints to the corresponding jaws. The surgical procedure of the maxilla and mandible was performed using these splints (Figure ).\\nAlveolar ridge augmentation was performed by harvesting a graft from the iliac crest. The graft was placed upon a surgical stent and fixed to the external maxillary surfaces with a screw and plate.\\nAfter 2 weeks, temporary complete dentures were delivered to the patient. They were adjusted using tissue conditioner (Kerr, USA). Six months later, an impression was made and a radiographic stent was fabricated for implant placement. To determine the proper location for placement of implants, gutta-percha points (VDW, Munich, Germany) were placed at the center of desired teeth in ideal direction of implant, and the outer surfaces of the teeth were coated with barium sulfate (Foshan Xinmei Chemical, Guangdong, China) (Figure ).\\nThe patient underwent cone beam computed tomography with stent to determine the proper site of implant placement (Figure ). Proper diagonal length and angle of 16 implants (Dentium, Implantium, Korea, Seoul), eight in each jaw, were determined by stent according to the available bone volume. Implants were inserted using a surgical stent. The temporary complete dentures of patient were relined and delivered to the patient. Three months later, the implants were uncovered, and healing abutments were tightened. Primary impression of the healing was made by alginate (Kimica, Tokyo, Japan). Primary cast was poured. After fabrication of special tray, final impression was made using the open tray technique following splinting of impression copings using polyvinyl siloxane (Zhengzhou Huaer, Henan, China).

A serum Ig-free light chain study revealed increased levels of both free kappa light chain (61.5 mg/l; reference range 2.42–18.92 mg/l) and free lambda light chain (88.1 mg/l; reference range 4.44–26.18 mg/l) (kappa/lambda: 0.70).\\nExcisional biopsy of the tumor was performed. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrated a distinct population of abnormal plasma cells which were positive for CD56 (96%), CD38 (70%), CD45 (9%), and CD19 (1%). Approximately 96% of these tumor cells co-expressed cytoplasmic kappa and lambda light chain based on a CD38-positive gate strategy (Fig. ). Histologically, the specimen showed diffuse proliferation of plasmacytoid tumor cells with pale paranuclear area and dense chromatin, and immunohistochemistry showed that these tumor cells were strongly and diffusely positive for CD138 (Fig. a, b) and MUM1, and negative for CD3, CD20, and CD56. Immunohistochemistry for IgL demonstrated co-expression of kappa and lambda light chain (Fig. c, d). Additionally, we demonstrated in situ hybridization (ISH) targeting IgL mRNA using FFPE specimen, and ISH also revealed that tumor cells co-expressed kappa and lambda light chain (Fig. e, f). Bone marrow biopsy showed no evidence of plasmacytes showing dual expression or deviation of kappa and lambda light chain, and additional CT and MRI revealed no skeletal abnormality except for the primary lesion, and absence of end-organ damage attributable to a proliferative plasma cell disorder.\\nWe reviewed the previous specimen and performed additional IgL immunohistochemistry. The sample revealed a histological pattern similar to that of the later sample as well as co-expression of kappa and lambda light chain (Additional file : Fig. S1).\\nTaking these findings together, the tumor was diagnosed as SPB with dual expression of the kappa and lambda light chains. After diagnosis, the patient underwent nine courses of VRD (bortezomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) therapy, which reduced the size of the lesion. Two years after diagnosis, the lesions have not increased in size, and bone marrow examinations have shown no progression to PCM.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1. The most likely diagnosis.\n2. Two alternative differential diagnoses.\n3.

In response to Janice's increasing needs for support, Gwen, her daughter and primary caregiver, scheduled an appointment for them to meet with her mother's Geriatrician to discuss changes in Janice's health and function related to her progressing dementia, and planned to discuss her own needs for support as well.\\nGwen reported to the geriatrician that her mother's decline had been steady since her last appointment, most notably in her short term memory such that she was increasingly losing items, struggling to recall recent events, forgetting names, and having difficulty finding words, managing complex tasks, and planning. She shared that her mother had developed paranoia and visual hallucinations over the past year during which she imagines that strangers are trying to get into her home to steal her treasured belongings. The hallucinations had increased steadily and had worsened over the past month now occurring multiple times per week usually at night. Gwen also reported that Janice calls her frequently asking for help, and she noticed her mother being more irritable, angry, and frustrated than she used to be. She shared that her mother wanders out of her room but has not gotten lost.\\nGwen also noted a “quite rapid” decline in Janice's function. Because she was no longer able to use the stove and had burned pots, she ultimately stopped cooking and depends on microwave-ready meals and easy snacks. Even with Gwen bringing her meals, however, Janice has had a 20 pound weight loss over the past year. Janice can still perform basic activities of daily living such as dressing, grooming, bathing, feeding, toileting, transfers and mobilization. She can still use the phone and does housekeeping and laundry on her own, but Gwen finds clothes soaked in urine in the laundry and believes that her mother has not bathed in a month. Gwen now manages her mother's money, medical appointments, and medications, and does her shopping and other errands as well.\\nJanice's neighbors and building management started to raise concerns to Gwen about her mother's safety, which Gwen reported has greatly increased her own anxiety about her mother's living situation. They reported that Janice is seen wandering around the facility at all hours and often checks in with other residents when she gets confused about day and time. There are times when she will knock on her neighbors' doors asking for help while experiencing hallucinations. They know her well and reassure and redirect her but Gwen wonders how long they will be willing to do this. Janice adamantly denies needing assistance but Gwen was finally able to get her to accept homecare for help with medications. The agency recently informed Gwen, however, that Janice does not always open the door for the homecare attendants and that she sometimes calls them derogatory names and yells at them to “get out.”\\nConcurrent problems: While Janice has experienced urinary incontinence for years, she was managing on her own with pads and then protective underwear as the incontinence worsened. Gwen describes her mother's bladder control as “good during the day” but notes that she “occasionally soaks her night clothes and bed during the night.” Janice also has occasional bowel incontinence and Gwen noticed that her pericare had declined and shared that she had found smeared stool around the toilet. The geriatrician also expressed concern about Janice's sensory deprivation noting that she is legally blind due to macular degeneration and that she suffers from bilateral hearing loss and has been unable to manage hearing aids on her own. Janice's other medical conditions include hypertension, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and hypothyroidism. She never smoked, rarely consumes alcohol, and gave up driving 3 years ago because of her vision loss.\\nMental exam: The geriatrician noted that Janice was alert and cooperative and that she needed a pocket talker to hear. She scored 24/30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam () and 18/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (), both of which indicate “mild dementia.” The Clock Drawing Test (), a measure of spatial dysfunction and neglect, was abnormal. She correctly placed the numbers on the clock face but could not tell time. She had problems with orientation and displayed both short and long term memory deficits. Language skills were intact other than occasional word finding problems. She appeared anxious and got easily irritated. She needed reassurance to complete the assessment. She was occasionally distracted by visual hallucinations (e.g., she saw people in the room and wanted them chased away). She denied symptoms of depression. She had poor insight into her cognitive and functional decline and displayed poor mental reasoning when it came to supports needed to help her with her health and housing. She overestimated her abilities and did not recognize the degree of supports being provided to her. She acknowledged that her daughter provides some help but said she could manage without it. She expressed annoyance with having homecare.\\nPhysical exam: No apparent distress.\\nFamily and social history: Janice completed education through Grade 8 and worked as a secretary until she had children. She has been widowed for 20 years after having been a caregiver to her husband who died of cancer. She has 3 daughters, 1 son, and 8 grandchildren. Gwen, the youngest, her primary caregiver, and “the baby” of the family, is married, has 2 children, and lives 10 min away. Janice's son, Jack, is an accountant who lives out of town, helps with higher level financial management such as taxes, and is a source of emotional support for Gwen. Janice often mentions that Jack “leads a busy life with work and family” as an explanation for his infrequent visits. Her two older daughters are both married, retired, and live in other provinces. They check in about their mother periodically and visit once a year. Neither of the two older daughters is close to Janice or Gwen with the emotional distance rooted in their shared belief that their mother favored their two younger siblings when they were growing up. Gwen and Jack have remained close and frequently discuss their mother's deteriorating health and function. Janice has lived in her current residence, a subsidized senior housing facility, for the past 30 years. She has limited finances, including her husband's pension and her own, and she relies on her children to assist with money as needed.\\nPatient's values and beliefs: Janice does not want to leave her home. She is feisty and wishes to remain independent. She is fond of her belongings and takes pride in them– e.g., furniture, paintings, pictures, collectibles, etc. She believes that she raised her children well and gave them a good education, and she now expects reciprocity. She acknowledges the support provided by her daughter but is not particularly empathic toward her stress.\\nMedical and legal issues: Janice designated Gwen and Jack as the agents in her Personal Directives and Enduring Power of Attorney (EPOA), respectively. The EPOA was activated at the time it was established. Janice's Goals of Care Designation, a medical order used in Alberta to describe and communicate the general focus of care including the preferred care location, indicates that goals and interventions are for cure or control of illness. Her goals exclude the option of ICU care, while transfer to an acute care facility may be considered if required for diagnosis and treatment.\\nCaregiver stress: Gwen is committed to caring for her mother and determined to support her at home. She reported that she had promised not to relocate her to a “nursing home.” However, she admits to feeling “very stressed” caring for her mother. She is the only one in town and has taken over the majority of the responsibilities. Janice is quite demanding and calls her day and night asking for help. She gets easily irritated and angry with Gwen who has already reduced her hours at work by going part-time. Gwen believes at this rate she will have to quit work all together. This adds to her stress because she feels guilty about harming her family's financial situation. She and her husband annually spend $6,000 subsidizing her mother's housing, food, and health care supplies. Gwen is keenly aware that their daughters are approaching college age and that this is not the time to leave the workforce. She feels that her life is “on hold.” Her husband and children are supportive and help however they are able. She resents the lack of support from her sisters but finds her brother more supportive as he provides her with emotional support and helps to support their mother financially. At the same time she feels he could visit more often. She shared that caregiving is taking a toll on her health as she is experiencing panic attacks, insomnia, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, and chronic migraines, in addition to having emotional and physical symptoms associated with perimenopause.", "age_raw": "[[85.0, 'year']]", "age_years": 85.0, "gender": "F", "history": "The following case is presented to illustrate, using a biopsychosocial-ecological perspective, three different approaches to serving persons with dementia and their caregiver(s) in clinical practice.\\nPresenting concerns: Janice is an 85-year-old woman who lives independently in senior housing in the Canadian province of Alberta.

She had poor insight into her cognitive and functional decline and displayed poor mental reasoning when it came to supports needed to help her with her health and housing. She overestimated her abilities and did not recognize the degree of supports being provided to her. She acknowledged that her daughter provides some help but said she could manage without it. She expressed annoyance with having homecare.\\nPhysical exam: No apparent distress.\\nFamily and social history: Janice completed education through Grade 8 and worked as a secretary until she had children. She has been widowed for 20 years after having been a caregiver to her husband who died of cancer. She has 3 daughters, 1 son, and 8 grandchildren. Gwen, the youngest, her primary caregiver, and “the baby” of the family, is married, has 2 children, and lives 10 min away. Janice's son, Jack, is an accountant who lives out of town, helps with higher level financial management such as taxes, and is a source of emotional support for Gwen. Janice often mentions that Jack “leads a busy life with work and family” as an explanation for his infrequent visits. Her two older daughters are both married, retired, and live in other provinces. They check in about their mother periodically and visit once a year. Neither of the two older daughters is close to Janice or Gwen with the emotional distance rooted in their shared belief that their mother favored their two younger siblings when they were growing up. Gwen and Jack have remained close and frequently discuss their mother's deteriorating health and function. Janice has lived in her current residence, a subsidized senior housing facility, for the past 30 years. She has limited finances, including her husband's pension and her own, and she relies on her children to assist with money as needed.\\nPatient's values and beliefs: Janice does not want to leave her home. She is feisty and wishes to remain independent. She is fond of her belongings and takes pride in them– e.g., furniture, paintings, pictures, collectibles, etc. She believes that she raised her children well and gave them a good education, and she now expects reciprocity. She acknowledges the support provided by her daughter but is not particularly empathic toward her stress.\\nMedical and legal issues: Janice designated Gwen and Jack as the agents in her Personal Directives and Enduring Power of Attorney (EPOA), respectively. The EPOA was activated at the time it was established. Janice's Goals of Care Designation, a medical order used in Alberta to describe and communicate the general focus of care including the preferred care location, indicates that goals and interventions are for cure or control of illness. Her goals exclude the option of ICU care, while transfer to an acute care facility may be considered if required for diagnosis and treatment.\\nCaregiver stress: Gwen is committed to caring for her mother and determined to support her at home. She reported that she had promised not to relocate her to a “nursing home.” However, she admits to feeling “very stressed” caring for her mother. She is the only one in town and has taken over the majority of the responsibilities. Janice is quite demanding and calls her day and night asking for help. She gets easily irritated and angry with Gwen who has already reduced her hours at work by going part-time. Gwen believes at this rate she will have to quit work all together. This adds to her stress because she feels guilty about harming her family's financial situation. She and her husband annually spend $6,000 subsidizing her mother's housing, food, and health care supplies. Gwen is keenly aware that their daughters are approaching college age and that this is not the time to leave the workforce. She feels that her life is “on hold.” Her husband and children are supportive and help however they are able. She resents the lack of support from her sisters but finds her brother more supportive as he provides her with emotional support and helps to support their mother financially. At the same time she feels he could visit more often. She shared that caregiving is taking a toll on her health as she is experiencing panic attacks, insomnia, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, and chronic migraines, in addition to having emotional and physical symptoms associated with perimenopause.", "exam": "", "findings": "", "diagnosis": "", "differential_diagnosis": "", "treatment": "", "relevant_articles": {"25855820": 1, "7369396": 1, "26796655": 1, "31466897": 1, "16981838": 1, "29361074": 1, "24329821": 1, "33545558": 1, "17882498": 1, "17548782": 1, "14589710": 1, "31858674": 1, "30967164": 1, "30909717": 1, "24354332": 1, "21425345": 1, "28069886": 1, "15169616": 1, "31298698": 1, "25531688": 1, "22998017": 1, "5922263": 1, "15817019": 1, "23099508": 1, "26593303": 1, "15211531": 1, "32620034": 1, "32949440": 1, "31720360": 1, "847460": 1, "31790271": 1, "28587690": 1, "28364258": 1, "24479141": 1, "28873041": 1, "30422731": 1, "1202204": 1, "33756057": 1, "23599727": 1, "17823840": 1, "29389937": 1, "27531724": 1, "26213337": 1, "20561384": 1, "30886898": 1, "32494332": 1, "24118831": 1, "27029913": 1, "34975562": 2}, "similar_patients": {}, "llm_prompt": "Patient: 85 yr, Female\n\nClinical presentation:\nThe following case is presented to illustrate, using a biopsychosocial-ecological perspective, three different approaches to serving persons with dementia and their caregiver(s) in clinical practice.\\nPresenting concerns: Janice is an 85-year-old woman who lives independently in senior housing in the Canadian province of Alberta. In response to Janice's increasing needs for support, Gwen, her daughter and primary caregiver, scheduled an appointment for them to meet with her mother's Geriatrician to discuss changes in Janice's health and function related to her progressing dementia, and planned to discuss her own needs for support as well.\\nGwen reported to the geriatrician that her mother's decline had been steady since her last appointment, most notably in her short term memory such that she was increasingly losing items, struggling to recall recent events, forgetting names, and having difficulty finding words, managing complex tasks, and planning. She shared that her mother had developed paranoia and visual hallucinations over the past year during which she imagines that strangers are trying to get into her home to steal her treasured belongings. The hallucinations had increased steadily and had worsened over the past month now occurring multiple times per week usually at night. Gwen also reported that Janice calls her frequently asking for help, and she noticed her mother being more irritable, angry, and frustrated than she used to be. She shared that her mother wanders out of her room but has not gotten lost.\\nGwen also noted a “quite rapid” decline in Janice's function. Because she was no longer able to use the stove and had burned pots, she ultimately stopped cooking and depends on microwave-ready meals and easy snacks. Even with Gwen bringing her meals, however, Janice has had a 20 pound weight loss over the past year. Janice can still perform basic activities of daily living such as dressing, grooming, bathing, feeding, toileting, transfers and mobilization. She can still use the phone and does housekeeping and laundry on her own, but Gwen finds clothes soaked in urine in the laundry and believes that her mother has not bathed in a month. Gwen now manages her mother's money, medical appointments, and medications, and does her shopping and other errands as well.\\nJanice's neighbors and building management started to raise concerns to Gwen about her mother's safety, which Gwen reported has greatly increased her own anxiety about her mother's living situation. They reported that Janice is seen wandering around the facility at all hours and often checks in with other residents when she gets confused about day and time. There are times when she will knock on her neighbors' doors asking for help while experiencing hallucinations. They know her well and reassure and redirect her but Gwen wonders how long they will be willing to do this. Janice adamantly denies needing assistance but Gwen was finally able to get her to accept homecare for help with medications. The agency recently informed Gwen, however, that Janice does not always open the door for the homecare attendants and that she sometimes calls them derogatory names and yells at them to “get out.”\\nConcurrent problems: While Janice has experienced urinary incontinence for years, she was managing on her own with pads and then protective underwear as the incontinence worsened. Gwen describes her mother's bladder control as “good during the day” but notes that she “occasionally soaks her night clothes and bed during the night.” Janice also has occasional bowel incontinence and Gwen noticed that her pericare had declined and shared that she had found smeared stool around the toilet. The geriatrician also expressed concern about Janice's sensory deprivation noting that she is legally blind due to macular degeneration and that she suffers from bilateral hearing loss and has been unable to manage hearing aids on her own. Janice's other medical conditions include hypertension, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and hypothyroidism. She never smoked, rarely consumes alcohol, and gave up driving 3 years ago because of her vision loss.\\nMental exam: The geriatrician noted that Janice was alert and cooperative and that she needed a pocket talker to hear. She scored 24/30 on the Mini-Mental State Exam () and 18/30 on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (), both of which indicate “mild dementia.” The Clock Drawing Test (), a measure of spatial dysfunction and neglect, was abnormal. She correctly placed the numbers on the clock face but could not tell time. She had problems with orientation and displayed both short and long term memory deficits. Language skills were intact other than occasional word finding problems. She appeared anxious and got easily irritated. She needed reassurance to complete the assessment. She was occasionally distracted by visual hallucinations (e.g., she saw people in the room and wanted them chased away). She denied symptoms of depression.

She reported pain in the left wrist and hand, with intensity 10 on the Numeric Pain Rating Scale (NRS), pulsating, and always present, thus preventing any movement. Marked hypersensitivity and allodynia were present at the level of the left fingers, wrist and hand. Pain was present in both flexion and extension of the wrist and caused a marked reduction in strength in the left wrist and hand, making a handshake impossible for the girl. There was no redness but swelling and sweating at the level of the fingers of the left hand. The pain was so intense that it interfered with her regular attendance at school, generating social withdrawal phenomena, which are unfortunately very frequent in patients with chronic pain.\\nPain began three months before the consultation, after an accidental fall with trauma to the left wrist. It gradually increased and did not respond to either NSAIDs or limb immobilization. The diagnostic tests performed at the time (X-ray, Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging) were negative, as were the blood chemistry tests ( and ).\\nFrom the age of 8, the girl was followed by a pediatrician in our hospital for a history of cramps and pain in the lower limbs, especially in the ankle and left knee, both in the absence of trauma or caused by frequent falls. In the following years, clinicians found bilateral flatfoot (with subsequent surgery), mild ligamentous hyperlaxity and vitamin D deficiency. In addition, borderline cognitive level with motor coordination disorder and executive function deficit, as well as stuttering, were then diagnosed. Elements of anxiety emerged from the administration of Self Administered Psychiatric Scales for Children and Adolescents (SAFA-A, D and S) questionnaires, as highlighted in particular by the subscales “Separation anxiety” and “Generalized anxiety” [,]. Concern for one’s own health was observed, with experiences of herself as being ill; the scores indicate a propensity to somatize. There was a tone of mood oriented in a deflected sense, and insecurity. The results of the Lie scale were: 8; T: 65 [,]. In addition to pulsating headache with phono and photophobia, frontal epilepsy was also diagnosed, which could explain the frequent falls, and moreover had excluded hyperbaric oxygen therapy as a feasible regimen in this case (due to a cost/benefit evaluation, and increased exposure to oxygen toxicity during the treatment itself). Episodes of dizziness with difficulty in maintaining an upright position lasting a few hours were also observed, and on two occasions she also had an episode of unconsciousness lasting about 2 min.\\nDuring the first visit, as a consequence of the mother’s need to have time to convince the recalcitrant daughter, in the meantime it was recommended to administer oral tramadol (100 mg/mL), 5 gtt in the morning and 5 gtt in order to reduce musculoskeletal pain. The reason for choosing a drug such as tramadol rather than any other pharmacological option lies in the fact that the pain was so intense that it affected the patient’s relationships []. We therefore opted for a drug that would have an immediate effect, so as to be able to undertake the acupuncture course. Subsequently, in the first two sessions, after careful disinfection of the skin with 2% chlorhexidine, and using the appropriate needles for length and diameter based on the type of acupuncture and the selected points, we used the following acupoints: TE 4 (Yang Pool), TE 5 (Waiguan), LI 5 (Yang Xi) and SI 4 (Wan Gu), all on the left side. These points were chosen on the basis of a pathology which, according to traditional Chinese medicine, was caused by cold wind. These points produced heat and dissipated the wind []. The needles were kept for 30′, with stimulation every 10′. In the third session, the girl reported a slight improvement in the painful symptoms but at the same time unbearable pain in the affected limb during the previous sessions due to the insertion and maintenance of the needles in the affected area. We decided to change strategy and to use abdominal acupuncture and stimulation of the points CV 4 (Guan Yuan), CV 12 (Zhong Wan), CV 16 (Zhong Ting), CV 17 (Shan Zong), ST 24 bilateral (Huaroumen) and KI 17 bilateral (Shang Qu), with appropriate needles and maintaining the same interspeed and time of stimulation. The needles were inserted to a depth of 0.2 cun. These new points (CV 4, CV 12, CV 16, CV 17 and KI 17), in addition to heating and dissipating the wind, re-established the correct circulation of qi []. In fact, used in combination, their purpose was to move the qi from the kidney to the extremity of the upper limb passing through the shoulder [,]. ST 24 was used to calm the patient and increase her compliance with acupuncture [].\\nAuriculotherapy was also associated with Vaccaria seeds on the Wrist, Hand and Shenmen points, with the recommendation to stimulate them at home for 10 min, 4 times a day until the next session. Vaccaria seeds are used to stimulate certain points in auriculotherapy due to their almost spherical shape, and the absence of pharmacological properties []. The Shenmen point was chosen for its anxiolytic effect, given the patient’s psychological difficulties [].\\nAfter eight sessions (two months) of abdominal acupuncture the pain completely disappeared (Numeric Pain Rating Scale value 0) and the girl regained full functional capacity of the arm and a normal life. Follow-up at three months, six months and one year demonstrated complete remission of symptoms, with constant values of NRS equal to 0.

According to medical evaluation, the pain extended to the perineal and inguinal regions and it was reported to be more acute during erection. The patient was referred by urologist for sonographic evaluation of penis and testes. The pain had started 3 days before the urologist examination, following his first full erection for intercourse, after his positive COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test.\\nThe patient did not have any other urologic symptoms such as discharge, hematuria, or dysuria. He denied any trauma to the penis, previous pelvic tumor, pelvic surgery and history of recent immobilization. He did not use vasoconstrictive drugs. The patient reported positive nosopharyngeal swab test for COVID-19 three weeks earlier. He had mild symptoms of COVID-19 infection including muscle pain, fever, cough, and fatigue. He had received conservative treatment and had not taken any anti-coagulants, antivirals, and corticosteroids. His medical history did not show any significant underlying disease and any risk factor for cardiovascular disease. He also did not have history of previous deep vein thrombosis. In physical examination of the penis and testes, no pathologic finding was detected such as skin tissue changes, discoloration, edema, tenderness, or palpable nodularity.\\nUltrasound evaluation showed thrombosis of deep dorsal penile vein while the superficial dorsal penile vein, iliac veins, and inferior vena cava were intact (Figures ,,).\\nLaboratory tests revealed slightly increased D-dimer level(may be due to inflammatory process of COCID-19 infection), normal levels of fibrinogen, anti-thrombin III, protein S, Protein C, anti-cardiolipin antibodies and normal count of platelets and white blood cell counts. Also Tests were negative for anti-phospholipid-IgG, IgM, and lupus anti-coagulant (Table ).\\nImmediately after sonographic diagnose of deep dorsal penile vein thrombosis, the Rivaroxaban treatment was started with the dosage of 15 mg twice a day.

Three weeks before admission to PUMCH, she was seen at a local clinic (Haikou City, Hainan Island, located in the southern end of China) for fever and constipation. Physical examination was normal, and she was treated with ibuprofen. One week later, she presented to Haikou People's Hospital with a persistent high fever of over 39.5°C, irritability, and crying during the night. The result of head computer tomography scan was normal, and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 140 mm H2O. Her cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was clear and had 120 × 106/L white blood cells with 38% neutrophils and 62% lymphocytes. The patient was treated for viral meningitis with an antiviral for 2 weeks. Thereafter, she refused to walk because of lower limb pain. The patient's fever was not relieved by treatment.\\nThis girl was gravida 1 para 1 and was the full-term baby of an uncomplicated pregnancy. She had been raised in the countryside of Hainan Island.

The physical examination showed that she had a weight of 11.5 kg and a temperature of 40°C. Rashes, lymphadenectasis, and joint redness were not observed. Skin sensation could not be evaluated because the patient responded to any skin contact with exaggeration and crying. The patient's muscle strength and tone were normal even though she refused to stand or walk. The jerk reflexes of her limbs were symmetrical, and her pathological reflex was negative. No obvious focal neurologic signs were detected.\\nLaboratory tests showed a peripheral blood leukocyte count of 12.6 × 109/L with an increased eosinophil count of 21.3% and absolute eosinophil count of 2.69 × 109/L. The results of renal and liver function tests and routine urine and stool tests were normal.

A laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) for acute cholecystitis was performed approximately at another hospital approximately two months prior to presentation. She developed a surgical site infection with Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteremia following her LC and was treated successfully with intravenous (IV) antibiotics. The postoperative course was also complicated by choledocholithiasis requiring an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with stone pulverization and placement of two plastic 10F × 12 cm biliary stents. Two days prior to admission, she was hospitalized at an outside facility in septic shock with fevers, chills, lethargy, altered mental status, and blood and urine cultures positive for E. coli. At that time, she endorsed right hip pain and an inability to move her hip or leg. A computed tomography (CT) scan of her right hip revealed two partly calcified soft tissue masses associated with the right iliopsoas and obturator internus muscles (). A CT-guided fine needle biopsy of the right hip and psoas locules aspirated 100 mL of frank pus notable for a nucleated cell count of 344,000 (98% PMNs) with growth of E. coli. As a result, the patient was transferred to our institution with concerns for an iliopsoas abscess and a periprosthetic infection.\\nOn admission, she was febrile to 102.7 F without any significant distress. Her physical examination was remarkable for a well-healed, right lateral hip incision with no erythema or drainage. She experienced pain with right hip flexion and internal rotation. Laboratory studies showed WBC, hemoglobin and hematocrit, basic metabolic profile, and liver function tests all within normal limits. A 3 cm hepatic abscess was identified on CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis. An MRI of the right hip showed a large air- and fluid-filled collection tracking along the iliopsoas bursa and psoas musculature into the pelvis (). This collection communicated with the hip prosthesis, and on CT imaging, the acetabulum component appeared to be medialized beyond the medial wall of the acetabulum as depicted in . Regarding the hepatic abscess, the patient was managed with IV antibiotics and interventional radiology (IR) placed drainage catheter.\\nTo address the hip periprosthetic infection, the patient was managed in multiple surgical stages. In the first stage, an irrigation and debridement of the right hip and explantation of components were performed through an anterior approach. The femoral and acetabular components were explanted. Purulent material was seen draining from the pelvis through a medial acetabular wall defect into the hip joint. Approximately 1 liter of pus was evacuated from the hip joint. Multiple irregularly shaped granulated pea-sized pieces of hard brown substance were found deep in the acetabulum. A handful of this material was removed which suggested that these were spilled gallstones from the patient's recent LC.\\nTemporary components were replanted with an antibiotic impregnated cement spacer system [] (Figures and ). An antibiotic cement spacer with gentamicin was placed in the acetabulum defect, and a loosely fitted antibiotic-cemented stem was placed in the proximal femur.\\nThe intrapelvic iliopsoas collection could not be fully debrided through the anterior approach, and IR was consulted for drain placement and serial debridements, which were conducted with a rotating basket Trerotola device over the course of the next four weeks. In , contrast dye can be seen tracking from within the iliopsoas abscess into the hip joint.\\nFour weeks following her explantation, the patient returned to the operating room for placement of a second temporary weight bearing custom-fitted prosthesis made from methyl methacrylate with gentamicin-impregnated antibiotics [] (Figures and ). For the acetabulum, methyl methacrylate was molded in its doughy state into the cavities and deformities of the acetabulum, and a polyethylene acetabulum was pressed into the cement. The femur was reamed to size of a large diameter chest tube. A femoral stem and a reinforcing wire were cemented into the chest tube, and once the cement was hardened, the femoral stem encased in a solid cylinder of bone cement was removed from the chest tube and malleted into the proximal femur.\\nPostoperatively, the patient did well.

He had a history of Parkinson’s disease with psychosis. He complained of left-sided chest pain and productive cough in the 2 months before admission. He reported no risk factors for HIV infection, occasional alcohol consumption, and was a current smoker with a 30-pack/year smoking history. Initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 77/56 mmHg; heart rate, 106/min; body temperature, 36.1 °C (97.0 °F). There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the oral cavity revealed poor dentition and inadequate hygiene. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to the angle of the jaw at 45° and did not change with respirations. The breath sounds attenuated at both sides, and dullness was present at the base of the bilateral lung. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rhythm, tachycardia, and distant heart sounds. Laboratory test values were as follows: white blood cells, 29,950/mm3 with a left shift; hemoglobin, 10.6 g/dl; platelets, 453,000/mm3; random serum glucose, 125 mg/dl (normal, 75–115 mg/dl); serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 260 U/l (normal,119–229 U/l); serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT), 80 U/l and 24 U/l (normal, 0–35 U/l); serum albumin, 3.1 g/dl (normal, 4–5 g/dl); serum C-reactive protein (CRP), 17.25 mg/dl (normal, < 0.2 mg/dl).

An electrocardiogram was normal. The patient received acute pericardiocentesis and pericardial drainage tube placement, which yielded approximately 800 ml of dark yellow fluid and restored blood pressure. Thoracentesis on both sides was performed and revealed yellow and turbid pleural fluid. Gram stain and cytologic examination of both pericardial and pleural fluid showed no organisms and also malignant cells. Examination of sputum showed no pathogen on staining. Two sets of blood culture specimens drawn at the time of admission did not yield any organisms. The patient was initially diagnosed with a bacterial pericarditis and lung abscess in the LLL.

He had a history of Parkinson’s disease with psychosis. He complained of left-sided chest pain and productive cough in the 2 months before admission. He reported no risk factors for HIV infection, occasional alcohol consumption, and was a current smoker with a 30-pack/year smoking history. Initial vital signs were as follows: blood pressure, 77/56 mmHg; heart rate, 106/min; body temperature, 36.1 °C (97.0 °F). There was no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. Examination of the oral cavity revealed poor dentition and inadequate hygiene. Jugular venous pressure was elevated to the angle of the jaw at 45° and did not change with respirations. The breath sounds attenuated at both sides, and dullness was present at the base of the bilateral lung. Cardiovascular examination revealed regular rhythm, tachycardia, and distant heart sounds. Laboratory test values were as follows: white blood cells, 29,950/mm3 with a left shift; hemoglobin, 10.6 g/dl; platelets, 453,000/mm3; random serum glucose, 125 mg/dl (normal, 75–115 mg/dl); serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 260 U/l (normal,119–229 U/l); serum aspartate and alanine aminotransferase (AST and ALT), 80 U/l and 24 U/l (normal, 0–35 U/l); serum albumin, 3.1 g/dl (normal, 4–5 g/dl); serum C-reactive protein (CRP), 17.25 mg/dl (normal, < 0.2 mg/dl). The chest radiograph (Fig. ) revealed a mass in the left upper lung, bilateral pleural effusions and cardiac enlargement. The chest computed tomography (CT) scan showed a wedge-shaped and pleural-based mass in the left upper lobe (LUL), a thick-walled cavitary lesion containing only water density in the left lower lobe (LLL), bilateral pleural effusions and pericardial effusion (Fig. ). An electrocardiogram was normal. The patient received acute pericardiocentesis and pericardial drainage tube placement, which yielded approximately 800 ml of dark yellow fluid and restored blood pressure. Thoracentesis on both sides was performed and revealed yellow and turbid pleural fluid. Gram stain and cytologic examination of both pericardial and pleural fluid showed no organisms and also malignant cells. Examination of sputum showed no pathogen on staining. Two sets of blood culture specimens drawn at the time of admission did not yield any organisms. The patient was initially diagnosed with a bacterial pericarditis and lung abscess in the LLL. Intravenous ceftriaxone was started as an empirical antimicrobial treatment.\\nAfter the admission, the patient continued to be afebrile and his respiratory and cardiovascular status was stable. On day 6, there was minimal pericardial fluid in the drainage tube so the drain was removed. In the morning of day 9, a fever of 39.0 °C (102.2 °F) and sinus tachycardia (150/min) occurred. The tachycardia continued for 4 h, and he experienced atrial fibrillation (Af). Immediately after the onset of Af, a cardiac arrest with asystole occurred. He underwent an immediate cardiopulmonary resuscitation, which restored sinus rhythm and blood pressure. Chest CT scan obtained on the same day revealed the remaining thick-walled cavitary lesion in the LLL and the reduced pericardial effusion.

The patient was endotracheally intubated and transferred via helicopter to our facility.\\nUpon arrival to our facility, she was receiving intravenous infusions of dopamine at 20 µg/kg/min and norepinephrine at 10 µg/kg/min and remained hypotensive (92/55 mm Hg) and bradycardic (59 beats/min). ECG showed an accelerated junctional rhythm. Laboratory findings included serum sodium of 139 mEq/L, potassium of 5.3 mEq/L, chloride of 108 mEq/L, and total CO2 content of 15 mmol/L, serum glucose of 208 mg/dL, urea nitrogen of 38 mg/dL, creatinine of 1.5 mg/dL, ionized calcium of 1.15 mmol/L, total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL, serum alkaline phosphatase of 141 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase of 2196 U/L, and alanine aminotransferase of 2010 U/L. Plasma troponin I was repeatedly undetectable. The peripheral leukocyte count was 15.9 x 109 cells/L with no immature forms. There was evidence of an anion gap metabolic acidosis with a serum lactate concentration of 6.2 mmol/L. Blood cultures revealed no microbial growth. Thyroid function testing showed an undetectable TSH (<0.10 µlU/ml), a free T4 of 12.8 (normal: 0.6 to 1.6) ng/dL, total T4 of 21.9 (normal: 5.6 to 13.7) µg/dL, and a total T3 of 0.94 (normal: 0.8 to 1.8) ng/mL. The patient was treated for thyroid storm with 1000 mg of propylthiouracil by orogastric tube as a loading dose followed by 300 mg every 6 hours, 5 drops saturated solution of potassium iodide (SSKI) every 8 hours by orogastric tube, and 100 mg intravenously of hydrocortisone every 8 hours. The hypotension resolved, vasopressors were stopped, and the patient was extubated 25 hours after her initial presentation. During her stay in the intensive care unit, the patient exhibited fever (39.6°C maximum), tachycardia, and tremulousness. These manifestations resolved over a period of 22 hours. The patient was discharged in satisfactory condition on the fourth day of hospitalization on 100 mg of propylthiouracil orally every 8 hours. Outpatient testing days later demonstrated normalization of her thyroid function tests.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1. The most likely diagnosis.\n2.

{"uid": "6011100-1", "pmid": "29977620", "title": "Glucose Management during Insulinoma Resection Using Real-Time Subcutaneous Continuous Glucose Monitoring", "patient": "A 12-year-old girl (height, 144 cm; weight, 40 kg) was presented to the hospital with an episode of seizure with impaired consciousness. Her BG at that time was 60 mg/dL (normal value of casual BG: 70–200 mg/dL). Glucose was administered and she recovered consciousness. She had no significant comorbidities prior to hospital admission. From her family history and further investigation, she was diagnosed as having insulinoma and hyperparathyroidism in MEN-1. Arterial phase images of computed tomography showed a vascularity-rich tumor of 20 mm in diameter located in the head of the pancreas. The feeding artery of the tumor was not clearly demonstrated by angiography and selective arterial calcium injection. We considered that extended surgical procedures such as pancreatoduodenectomy might be required depending on intraoperative findings; therefore, open abdominal surgery rather than laparoscopic surgery was scheduled. Her intact parathyroid hormone level was 66.0 pg/ml (normal value: 10–65 pg/mL) and her adjusted serum calcium level was 10.3 mg/dL (normal value: 8.7–9.9 mg/dL), although parathyroid ultrasound examination revealed no parathyroid tumor. Other tumors complicated with MEN-1 were not detected. The results of other preoperative examinations were unremarkable. On the day before surgery, an Enlite™ sensor of MiniMed™ 620G (Medtronic Diabetes, Northridge, CA, USA) SCGM system was inserted into her upper arm. Although MiniMed 620G was combined with an insulin pump, we did not use the pump. The SCGM system was calibrated as recommended by the manufacturer with capillary BG measured by OneTouch® UltraVue™ Blood Glucose Meter (Johnson & Johnson, New Brunswick, NJ, USA).\\nNo premedication was given and she walked into the operating room. Capillary BG was 80 mg/dL and the SCGM system was calibrated. Continuous glucose infusion was started at 4.6 g/hr, and general anesthesia was induced with 80 mg of propofol, 50 mcg of fentanyl, and 0.02 mcg/kg/min of remifentanil. Muscle relaxation was obtained by administration of 30 mg of rocuronium, and the trachea was intubated. After induction of general anesthesia, an epidural catheter was inserted at the eighth and ninth thoracic interspace. Anesthesia was maintained with 1.7% sevoflurane, 0.01–0.02 mcg/kg/min of remifentanil, and intermittent thoracic epidural administration of 0.25% levobupivacaine (3 ml). An arterial catheter was inserted, and arterial BG measured by an ABL800 Flex Blood Gas Analyzer (Radiometer, Brea, CA, USA) was 71 mg/dL, which was compatible with IG of 73 mg/dL.

On evaluation, he was tachycardic with a pulse of 113, hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 130-170 mmHg, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. He was supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen while a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was obtained, which revealed a saddle PE (Fig. ).\\nTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion and admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for management. He remained on the heparin infusion for 3 days, during which he continuously improved and was eventually weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. On hospital day 2, he was transferred to intermediate level of care. Per hematology recommendations, he would have to be on indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE he had sustained, the source of which was a left lower extremity popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan was to transition him from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin twice per day with hematology follow-up in 1 month.\\nOn the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. He had previously been working with physical therapy and had been able to walk 200 feet with the assistance of a walker during each session. A physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch, 2/5 strength in right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. Left leg physical examination was normal at that time.\\nAn emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered due to concern for a possible stroke, and neurology was consulted. The head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma (Fig. ). A CT of his pelvis performed the same day also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. Due to these findings, hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The following day his left leg began exhibiting the same symptoms as his right leg. There was concern regarding the risk of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not promptly drained. IR was consulted and advised that if the drainage were to occur while our patient was on anticoagulation, the risk of rebleeding into the retroperitoneum would be high and potentially nullify any benefit from drainage. Our patient would also be at risk of hemodynamic instability if the current hematomas were acting as tamponades against further bleeding. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. Hematology was consulted for recommendations on pausing anticoagulation, but they were hesitant to offer a timeframe as there was no established safe period to enable this type of procedure to take place. Eventually, a window period of pausing the heparin infusion for 3 hours pre-procedure and up to 6 hours post-procedure was decided upon in the event that our patient agreed to have the drainage performed.\\nThroughout this sequence of events, our patient and his wife were aware of the plans and considerations on how to proceed. They were informed of the recommendations and concerns made by neurology, hematology, and IR, as well as the risks and benefits of intervention versus non-intervention.\\nAfter speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in our patient’s right flank (Fig. ).

On evaluation, he was tachycardic with a pulse of 113, hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 130-170 mmHg, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. He was supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen while a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was obtained, which revealed a saddle PE (Fig. ).\\nTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion and admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for management. He remained on the heparin infusion for 3 days, during which he continuously improved and was eventually weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. On hospital day 2, he was transferred to intermediate level of care. Per hematology recommendations, he would have to be on indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE he had sustained, the source of which was a left lower extremity popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan was to transition him from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin twice per day with hematology follow-up in 1 month.\\nOn the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. He had previously been working with physical therapy and had been able to walk 200 feet with the assistance of a walker during each session. A physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch, 2/5 strength in right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. Left leg physical examination was normal at that time.\\nAn emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered due to concern for a possible stroke, and neurology was consulted. The head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma (Fig. ). A CT of his pelvis performed the same day also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. Due to these findings, hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The following day his left leg began exhibiting the same symptoms as his right leg. There was concern regarding the risk of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not promptly drained. IR was consulted and advised that if the drainage were to occur while our patient was on anticoagulation, the risk of rebleeding into the retroperitoneum would be high and potentially nullify any benefit from drainage. Our patient would also be at risk of hemodynamic instability if the current hematomas were acting as tamponades against further bleeding. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. Hematology was consulted for recommendations on pausing anticoagulation, but they were hesitant to offer a timeframe as there was no established safe period to enable this type of procedure to take place. Eventually, a window period of pausing the heparin infusion for 3 hours pre-procedure and up to 6 hours post-procedure was decided upon in the event that our patient agreed to have the drainage performed.\\nThroughout this sequence of events, our patient and his wife were aware of the plans and considerations on how to proceed. They were informed of the recommendations and concerns made by neurology, hematology, and IR, as well as the risks and benefits of intervention versus non-intervention.\\nAfter speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in our patient’s right flank (Fig. ). In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The left psoas hematoma was not found to be amenable to drainage.\\nOur patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved to 3/5 bilaterally, and knee flexion and extension improved to 4/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed. His recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions totaling 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Other sources of potential bleeding were evaluated and not found. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 (Fig. ) showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and our patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits. He was transitioned again from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin after 3 more days. His hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable. During this time, he worked with physical therapy, who recommended discharge to a skilled nursing facility where his strength began to improve somewhat. Follow-up was scheduled with neurology and hematology. On hospital day 18, he was safely discharged.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1. The most likely diagnosis.\n2.

The lesion was located in the mid rectum, 8 cm from the anal verge and, based on its detailed endoscopic appearance during chromoendoscopy, was labelled as a lateral spreading tumour granular type (LTS-G). The endoscopic biopsy demonstrated a tubular adenoma with high-grade dysplasia. In view of the size of the lesion, endoscopic mucosal resection was considered unfeasible and it was decided to proceed with surgical excision transanally by TAMIS. The day before surgery, patient had standard mechanical bowel preparation and at the time of anaesthetic induction received preoperative antibiotics (Cefazolin 2 g and Metronidazole 500 mg). The procedure was performed under general anaesthesia and the single incision laparoscopic surgery port (SILS™ Port, Covidien) was adopted and traditional laparoscopic instruments were used. The surgery lasted 2 h with no intraoperative complications. The rectal wall defect was washed with a povidone-iodine solution (Fig. ) and then closed by a running suture performed with a barbed suture (Covidien V-Loc™).\\nPatient had unremarkable past medical history and on admission routine laboratory profile was in normal range: WBC, 6.34 × 103/μL (reference value, 4–10 × 103/μL); platelets, 231 × 103/μL (reference value, 150–400 × 103/μL); prothrombin time (PT), 11.4 s (reference value, 10.0–13.4 s); activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), 34 s (reference value, 22.0–43.0 s); fibrinogen, 301 mg/dL (reference value, 160–450 mg/dL). Following surgery, the patient was allowed to be mobilised and to have a regular diet with no restriction, and standard prophylaxis for venous thrombosis was started with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH).\\nOn day 3, the patient developed a spike in temperature without any suspicious clinical evidences. She was passing flatus associated with the mucous discharge, the abdomen was soft and not tender, and digital rectal examination did not show any lump or collection. Laboratory data disclosed both a deranged coagulation profile with marked APTT prolongation (126 s), PT 12.5 s, fibrinogen 897 mg/dL, raised white blood cells count (WBC 21.00 × 103/μL) and procalcitonin 0.52 ng/mL (reference value, < 0.5 ng/mL). Cross-mixing studies of patient plasma and normal pooled plasma (25, 50, and 75%) insufficiently corrected the APTT (99, 71, and 56 s, respectively) after 2 h of incubation at 37 °C. Lupus anticoagulant assay was negative by dilute Russel viper venom test (DRVVT). FVIII, FXI, and FIX were in normal range whereas coagulant activity of FXII was < 1%, tested using one-stage APTT-based clotting assay.\\nConsidering the spike in temperature and laboratory data, a computed tomography (CT) of abdomen and pelvis was performed to rule out any collection and source of infection. The CT scan did not show any pelvic abscess, but there was evidence of perirectal fat suffusion related to the recent procedure. A rigid proctoscopy was performed showing the evidence of the partial dehiscence of rectal wall defect suture; no other abnormalities were noticed. Antibiotic therapy was started with intravenous ciprofloxacin and metronidazole (500 mg) three times a day. From a therapeutic point of view, there is a general consensus that patients with an FXII inhibitor do not need any correction of the APTT and so our patient did not receive any therapy in addition to antibiotics. LMWH standard prophylaxis for venous thrombosis, initially suspended, was resumed. In the next 7 days, the patient had no more fever and laboratory data improved while APTT was still prolonged (70 s). She was discharged home with no further intervention. The histopathological report demonstrated a tubular adenoma with low- and high-grade dysplasia with free excision margins. 45 days later endoscopy showed a complete mucosal healing, APTT and FXII activity were back to the normal value (38 s and 50%, respectively).

The patient presented to the clinic because of umbilical hernia pain, which developed over the two months. The pain localized to the periumbilical region and left lower back, and it was exacerbated with food intake and sometimes relieved by 5 mg hydrocodone tablet. He also reported nausea and fifteen pounds weight loss over the two months, which he attributed to decreased food intake. The physical examination showed a 1 cm tender and irreducible mass superior to the umbilicus. The patient underwent herniorrhaphy and the gross examination of the surgical specimen did not reveal any masses or lesions.\\nThe microscopic evaluation showed diffuse infiltration of the connective tissue by malignant cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, inconspicuous nucleoli, and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm (). There were focal areas of gland formation with mucin production, consistent with adenocarcinoma. By immunohistochemistry, the neoplastic cells were strongly positive for pancytokeratin and CK7 () and negative for CK20, CDX2, TTF-1 and PSA.\\nThe laboratory findings showed elevated levels of CA 19-9 (16,590 U/mL) and CEA (14.2 ng/mL). The patient underwent a subsequent computed tomography scan with intravenous contrast, which showed a 5.0 × 2.7 cm ill-defined and hypoattenuating mass located in the pancreatic tail and body (), with peripancreatic fat infiltration and vascular involvement of splenic artery and vein.

His comorbidities include hypertension managed with oral antihypertensive drugs and diabetes mellitus type 2. He has no significant allergies and never underwent any surgical procedure. He brings an ultrasound, which shows a 4 cm heterogenous mass in segment 8. His alfafetoprotein level is elevated to 76 ng/mL. He has no symptoms and looks in good performance status. We scheduled him for a triphasic CT scan, which shows a lesion of 4.3 cm with brisk arterial contrast and venous washout. According to the LIRADS classification, this lesion could be considered a class 5 with diagnostic features of hepatocellular carcinoma. The patient was discussed in our multidisciplinary tumor board including hepatobiliary and transplant surgeons, hepatologists, radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, and interventional radiologists. The plan was to submit the patient to curative intent treatments given his early presentation according to the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLC), namely surgical resection or liver transplantation; radiofrequency ablation was excluded given the tumor’s dimensions. Given the good performance status, the position of the lesion (which was right below the Glissonian capsule) and the liver function of the patients, the MDT decided to schedule the patient for surgery. We therefore saw the patient in clinic and discussed the procedure. Informed consent was signed, and liver function was tested using ICG retention rate. We used 0.5 mg/Kg corresponding to 40 mg in this 80 kg patient. The DICOM data of the CT scan of the patient were then submitted to our radiologist who performed a 3D reconstruction of the patient’s anatomy and the relationship of the lesion with the major vessels. Furthermore, the exact dimensions of the portal territories for segment 8 were reconstructed and showed on the model. We normally aim at the narrowest but still oncologically safe resection possible. The surgery is then planned on the model, identifying the borders of the resection and the exact location of the Glissonian pedicle to tackle and the hepatic veins to skeletonize and cut. Once the preoperative surgical plan is discussed between the surgeons and the radiologists, the patient can be scheduled for surgery. This generally happens 2 weeks from the administration of ICG to achieve a complete washout of the dye by the normal parenchyma and a retention by the tumor that will then be showed intraoperatively using the narrow band camera. The patient is scheduled for a laparoscopic anatomical segment 8 resection. In our experience, we use the so called “French position” to operate laparoscopic cases, with the patient standing in between the legs of the patient and two assistants on each side. Two screens in the operating room are dedicated to the endoscopic vision, one screen is dedicated to the intraoperative ultrasound, while one dedicated screen allows to show the preoperative surgical planning and therefore guide the resection throughout the case. We use a five-trocar technique with 1 umbilical port and 4 ports on the subcostal line. One port is epigastric and is very important for the dissection of the hepatocaval confluence. An extra 5 mm access is used to perform an extracorporeal Pringle manuever. Open laparoscopy access is gained at the level of the umbilicus. After inserting all the trocars, the narrow band camera is used to identify the HCC on the hepatic dome on segment 8, which is shining green because of the ICG administered 2 weeks before. Intraoperative ultrasound and doppler are then performed to confirm the border of the resection. Pringle manuever is prepared. Dissection is started from the hepatocaval confluence to immediately identify the middle and right hepatic veins. For segment 8 resections, no extensive right lobe mobilization is necessary unless exposure is limited. We then start our parenchymal transection using a combination of energy-based device clamp-crushing technique, CUSA dissection and bipolar coagulation. We identify the middle hepatic vein at its origin, and we carry our parenchymal transection in a cranio-caudal fashion, sweeping the liver parenchyma from the vein. This avoids any tearing on small peripheral branches of the middle hepatic vein. Slowly progressing caudally, we encroach the Glissonian pedicle for segment 8, going to the lesion and vascularizing the tumor bearing area. We test the pedicle using a bulldog clamp and checking with the doppler the absence of flow in segment 8 and the presence of flow in the remnant liver. We then ask the anesthesiologist to inject 1 mL of ICG intravenously. We will then see all the liver shining green but not segment 8, which is our resection area. Guided by the ICG we will then carry out the anatomical resection. The Glissonian pedicle is stapled, and the resection is carried out dissecting the whole resection area from the middle and right hepatic veins. Once the resection is finished, the vascularization of the remnant liver is checked both with the ICG and the doppler. A drain is generally not placed unless there are specific issues during the procedure.

{"uid": "6020505-1", "pmid": "30009069", "title": "A Rare Case of Large Schwannoma of the Parapharyngeal Space", "patient": "A 32-year-old man was referred to the Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kaunas Clinics Hospital with the symptoms of throat discomfort on the left side and dysphagia. The symptoms persisted for approximately 2 months. At arrival, the patient had no fever and there were no other signs of acute infection. Anamnestically, the patient was treated with antibiotics due to a suspected peritonsillar abscess on the left side for a period of 1 month. His left peritonsillar area was repeatedly punctured. However, only blood was obtained with a puncture. The prescribed antimicrobial therapy was not effective—dysphagia progressed, the patient started to report more speech difficulties, his lower jaw became numb, and taste dysfunction appeared. During pharyngoscopy, a dislocated lateral pharyngeal wall with mild inflammatory changes of the oropharyngeal mucosa was observed. The palate tonsil was displaced towards the uvula ()\\nThe fibronasolaryngoscopic investigation revealed that the left side of the nasopharynx was narrowed by a large mass covered with an intact smooth mucous membrane. No pathology was observed in the larynx—the color of mucosa was normal, and the vocal cords were mobile and smooth. No additional structures were seen. Neck lymph nodes could not be palpated.\\nDue to the suspected pharyngeal tumor, the patient underwent a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) study, which showed a clearly limited, oval-shaped lesion in the left parapharyngeal space ().\\nThe size of the tumor was 4.2 × 3.3 × 6.7 cm. It was characterized by a nonhomogeneous structure with multifocal intratumoral hemorrhages of varying ages. The tumor encased the carotid arteries and the styloid process, while it stretched the pterygoid muscles on the left side and remodeled the pterygoid processes of the sphenoid bone. The medial part of the tumor pushed the palatal tonsil and uvula towards the centerline, as well as the root of the tongue to the front and the middle. Moreover, it significantly deformed the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cavities. The upper part of the tumor ascended and tapered to the bone surface of the base of the skull and extracranial oval foramen. The lower pole of the tumor reached the submandibular salivary gland level and dislocated it slightly laterally.\\nTo clarify the diagnosis, the patient underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study. The study showed that due to its localization and tumor-specific features, the most likely diagnosis was schwannoma of the small branch of the mandibular nerve (V3) since a limited formation of specific localization with a component of cystic degeneration was found.

He had a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in October 2020, with classical radiological findings. He was managed conservatively under home quarantine. Two weeks later (November 2020), he had a recurrence of high spiking fever. Imaging revealed a left-sided lung consolidation. He was treated for probable pneumonia with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. At 1-month follow-up (December 2020), there was an inadequate clinical improvement with an increase in the size of the consolidation (Figure ). Bronchoscopy was done, and bronchoalveolar lavage grew Streptococcus pneumoniae. He received another course of linezolid antibiotic.\\nIn 2017, he had probable vaccine-related/autoimmune optic neuritis for which he received 13 doses of rituximab between January 2017 and May 2019 (600 mg per dose). He had developed rituximab-induced hypogammaglobulinaemia in 2019. Since then, he has had persistent B-cell depletion and low immunoglobulin levels (Table ). The absolute B-cell count was zero.\\nDuring our evaluation, SARS-CoV-2 real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was negative (February 2021 and March 2021). Antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (N) and spike receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) tested on the Roche Elecsys platform were undetectable in February 2021. We considered the following differentials: tuberculosis (TB), organizing pneumonia, lymphoma, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA) associated vasculitis and lung malignancy. Sputum Xpert-TB-PCR was negative. Multiple blood cultures, bone marrow biopsy and culture reports for routine bacteria, Mycobacterium and fungal organisms were negative. A bronchoscopic transbronchial lung biopsy was done. Histopathology was suggestive of organizing pneumonia. Past COVID-19 infection was considered as the likely cause for organizing pneumonia. He was started on high-dose steroids, with which he improved.\\nHe was readmitted in April 2021 with a persistent fever.
