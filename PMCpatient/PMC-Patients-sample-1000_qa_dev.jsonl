Initially the patient received lung-protective ventilation and targeted sedation, but was otherwise stable. Treatment interventions included passive range of motion and positioning including passive mobilization into a side-edge position (). Over the next days, the patient deteriorated with hemodynamic instability and severe ARDS leading to intermittent prone positioning and continuous renal replacement therapy. The role of physical therapists during proning was to ensure correct joint positioning and pressure prophylaxis to prevent secondary complications such as nerve lesions, contractures, or pressure ulcers. Nevertheless, the long duration and repeated positioning resulted in a small pressure ulcer on the patient’s forehead.

He had undergone a Billroth II procedure over 20 years ago for a distal gastric ulcer. Physical examination revealed a midline abdominal incision scar and mild tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Blood test results showed total bilirubin of 5 mg/dl and an unconjugated bilirubin of 3 mg/dl. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were two times higher than normal. Ultrasonography revealed multiple subcentimetric gallstones confined to the thin-walled gallbladder with dilated intrahepatic ducts, 12-mm calibrated choledocus, and other organs were normal. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealed a semi-obstructing gallstone 13-mm in diameter in the choledocus. Owing to his history of a Billroth II procedure, performing an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) for gallstone in the choledocus was not possible. Because of this reason, a surgical decision was taken. After a right subcostal incision, the gallbladder and the fatty tissues surrounding the choledocus were found to be oedematous. However, a cholecystectomy was performed without any complication, followed by choledocus exploration and stone extraction with a T-tube insertion. A latex, 12-foot T-tube was used in the operation. The horizontal branch of the T-tube was shortened, and the T-tube was incised to form a gutter, with a V-notch added at the junction of the two arms.

He had no past medical history of diabetes mellitus and major abdominal surgery. In the peritoneal equilibration test, his result was high. Bloody ascites was not evident. One year previously, he had been hospitalized for PD-associated peritonitis caused by touch contamination that was treated with intraperitoneal cephazoline and cephtazidime. Bowel adhesion was not noted 5 years previously; however, local bowel adhesions and agglomeration of the intestine were detected by computed tomography (CT) after the identification of PD-associated peritonitis (Fig. , ). The major findings of EPS, such as peritoneal thickening and calcification, were not noted on CT.\\nOn physical examination, his blood pressure was 134/74 mmHg, pulse rate was 76 beats/min, and temperature was 99.7 ° F. He complained of severe pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen, and this area was tender on palpation. The exit site was clear. Laboratory tests revealed mild inflammation, with a white blood cell count of 10,100 /μL and C-reactive protein level of 0.9 mg/dL. The peritoneal fluid cell count was increased at 980 /mL. Based on these findings, PD-associated peritonitis was diagnosed. CT showed localized dilation of the intestine, which suggested adhesive small bowel obstruction (Fig. ). As we suspected that the peritonitis might be associated with bacterial translocation from the dilated intestine, he was advised to stop eating and was switched from CAPD to hemodialysis. Additionally, he was treated with intravenous vancomycin and cephtazidime. The PD catheter was flushed once a day to prevent catheter obstruction with fibrin, and the characteristics of the peritoneal fluid were monitored.

Six years before, the patient had been operated on for the umbilical hernia, with the simple repair without a mesh. The patient was an active smoker who suffered from morbid obesity with a body mass index of 43 kg/m2 and COPD as comorbidities relevant for this case report.\\nThe patient was introduced to the surgeon during hospitalization at the gastroenterology department where a diagnostic workup due to a clinical picture of chronic small bowel obstruction was conducted. While taking the anamnesis, the patient reported frequent abdominal cramps, swelling, and pain in the area of the hernia that had intensified in the last few weeks. The physical examination revealed a large irreducible ventral hernia in the lower abdomen that was quite painful on palpation, but soft and, at that time, without signs of incarceration or strangulation. Taking into account the clinical picture with threatening hernia incarceration, the surgeon did not opt for preoperative optimization of the patient in terms of smoking cessation and starting a weight loss program but made an indication for semielective surgery.\\nOn operative procedure, greater omentum, part of the transverse colon, and a cluster of small bowel loops with signs of chronic obstruction were found as hernial content. After adhesiolysis hernial content was reduced into the abdominal cavity. Hernial defect measuring about 7 cm in diameter and about 15 cm in the vertical line with significant rectus diastase in the supraumbilical part of the abdomen was revealed. Using the Rives-Stoppa technique a wide retromuscular space was created. Lateral dissection boundaries of this space were perforating neurovascular bundles in the area of the lateral edges of the rectus muscle on both sides. The posterior fascia was easily closed using also a portion of the hernia sac to bridge the defect between the posterior rectus sheaths. A 30 × 25 cm polypropylene mesh was placed in the retromuscular space ensuring adequate mesh overlap over the edges of the hernia defect of a minimum of 5 cm in all directions.\\nWhen we observed that the anterior fascia, due to the size of the defect and decreased abdominal wall elasticity, would not close entirely and cover the mesh, we opted for rectus mobilization by the ACS method to avoid bridging. Upon extensive dissection of the anterior abdominal wall subcutaneous space without preservation of the rectus perforator vessels, relaxing incisions of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis were performed. Using the Ramirez technique, long longitudinal incisions of aponeurosis were made bilaterally, adjacently to the semilunar line, extending from the costal arch to the groin. This procedure resulted in the considerable mobilization of the vital musculofascial flap medially, and the hernial defect was closed at the midline without tension. Then, four redon drains were placed, i.e., 2 in the retrorectus space and another 2 in the subcutaneous space.\\nThe postoperative course was complicated by skin ischemia. Ischemic lesions of the abdominal wall skin on the right with signs of necrosis along the midline were observed already on day 8 (). On postoperative day 11, multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) of the abdomen was performed because of the ever more abundant wound discharge. MSCT findings showed a large subcutaneous seroma, a normal musculofascial component of the abdominal wall, appropriate mesh position, and normal intra-abdominal status. Percutaneous puncture of seroma was performed and about 800 ml of clear seroma was evacuated. During the next 10 days, ischemia progressed, along with the development of another two full-thickness skin necrotic foci paramedially (). Considering the relatively strict demarcation area of necrosis, we opted for the operative procedure of necrosectomy.\\nFollowing abdominal wall necrosectomy with a safety margin of healthy tissue and considering an appropriate amount of vital residual abdominal skin, as well as the absence of signs of local tissue infection or mesh infection, primary wound closure was performed in consultation with a plastic surgeon ().

At the time of initial examination, he denied headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, back or chest pain, rashes, focal weakness, or loss of sensation. He had not noticed any ticks or tick bites on his skin in the past year. On physical exam, he was noted to have normal extraocular muscle movements, neurologic exam without focal deficits, and musculoskeletal, cardiac, and respiratory exams without abnormalities.

He was born at term without any developmental delays and had no risk factors for epilepsy including traumatic brain injury, brain surgery, febrile seizures, central nervous system infections, or family history of seizures and no significant past medical or psychiatric comorbidities. Three years prior to his presentation he had his first seizure. He did not remember the event, but while attending basic training in the Army, he was reportedly found in the shower confused by his fellow soldiers. There was no tongue bite or urinary incontinence, but he was disoriented afterward for much of that day. He had another episode within the same month while he was performing physical training exercises, whereby he collapsed and remained confused for hours, but no report of witnessed convulsions. An evaluation at that time was unrevealing. He had 12 episodes in the next 3 years. They were all similar, some associated with lateral tongue laceration suffered during the event. He was seizure-free for 6 months and then began to have spells at least monthly. He denied an aura or premonition preceding his seizures. His wife reported at night that he would “cry” at the onset and then appears to have clonic jerking bilaterally and symmetrically, up to 3 minutes in duration. He was reported to be distressed for a few minutes after the episodes. Brain MRI was reportedly normal and EEG abnormal, but the reports were unavailable. He had been taking levetiracetam 3000 mg daily with topiramate 50 mg daily. He had also tried valproic acid but reportedly had abnormal labatory studies so this was discontinued. At his appointment, it was determined that he would continue his current regimen of levetiracetam, and topiramate was increased to 100 mg total daily. A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy was made upon clinical grounds though the classification included focal epilepsy localized to the frontal head region or genetic generalized epilepsy manifest as recurrent nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At his follow up appointment, a high-resolution 3-T brain MRI was performed and was normal without intracranial abnormalities. EEG demonstrated 3–4 Hz generalized polyspike-and-wave discharges supporting a clinical diagnosis of genetic generalized epilepsy. The patient and his wife had recorded a video of his habitual seizures, which was reviewed an epileptologists (WOT). As noted in the video, he appears agitated and combative and is thrashing his extremities in a non-rhythmic and discontinuous manner with side to side head movements with eyes closed (). He and his wife were clear that this was the semiology of his typical seizure. The side to side head movements, eye closure, and discontinuous nonrhythmic hypermotor activity suggested FS . He was subsequently admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for LTVEM for differential diagnosis and classification of recurrent events. During the admission, EEG redemonstrated interictal generalized spike and polyspike and slow wave complexes noted previously. He had one seizure with clinical semiology suggesting a focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure due to head version, yet lateralized and focal seizures are known to occur in genetic generalized epilepsies . Despite the appearance of focal features, the ictal EEG demonstrated a generalized seizure onset. Immediately following a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy with electroclinical support from a electroclinical bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, he exhibited the exact same post-ictal behavior that was witnessed in clinic while reviewing the smartphone video. This behavior observed on the smartphone video was therefore able to be linked to his habitual postictal state with violent thrashing that simulated a FS (). In discussion with the patient and his wife, the difference between his seizure and a postictal state with confusion and combativeness was underscored to define a sequence of events rather than separate events. LTVEM was therefore able to establish a diagnosis of genetic genealized epilepsy despite the history suggesting focal epilepsy and the smartphone video suggesting a FS.", "age_raw": "[[25.0, 'year']]", "age_years": 25.0, "gender": "M", "history": "A 25-year-old man presented to our epilepsy center for evaluation of seizures.

An evaluation at that time was unrevealing. He had 12 episodes in the next 3 years. They were all similar, some associated with lateral tongue laceration suffered during the event. He was seizure-free for 6 months and then began to have spells at least monthly. He denied an aura or premonition preceding his seizures. His wife reported at night that he would “cry” at the onset and then appears to have clonic jerking bilaterally and symmetrically, up to 3 minutes in duration. He was reported to be distressed for a few minutes after the episodes. Brain MRI was reportedly normal and EEG abnormal, but the reports were unavailable. He had been taking levetiracetam 3000 mg daily with topiramate 50 mg daily. He had also tried valproic acid but reportedly had abnormal labatory studies so this was discontinued. At his appointment, it was determined that he would continue his current regimen of levetiracetam, and topiramate was increased to 100 mg total daily. A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy was made upon clinical grounds though the classification included focal epilepsy localized to the frontal head region or genetic generalized epilepsy manifest as recurrent nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures. At his follow up appointment, a high-resolution 3-T brain MRI was performed and was normal without intracranial abnormalities. EEG demonstrated 3–4 Hz generalized polyspike-and-wave discharges supporting a clinical diagnosis of genetic generalized epilepsy. The patient and his wife had recorded a video of his habitual seizures, which was reviewed an epileptologists (WOT).

He and his wife were clear that this was the semiology of his typical seizure. The side to side head movements, eye closure, and discontinuous nonrhythmic hypermotor activity suggested FS . He was subsequently admitted to the epilepsy monitoring unit for LTVEM for differential diagnosis and classification of recurrent events. During the admission, EEG redemonstrated interictal generalized spike and polyspike and slow wave complexes noted previously. He had one seizure with clinical semiology suggesting a focal to bilateral tonic-clonic seizure due to head version, yet lateralized and focal seizures are known to occur in genetic generalized epilepsies . Despite the appearance of focal features, the ictal EEG demonstrated a generalized seizure onset. Immediately following a definitive diagnosis of epilepsy with electroclinical support from a electroclinical bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, he exhibited the exact same post-ictal behavior that was witnessed in clinic while reviewing the smartphone video. This behavior observed on the smartphone video was therefore able to be linked to his habitual postictal state with violent thrashing that simulated a FS (). In discussion with the patient and his wife, the difference between his seizure and a postictal state with confusion and combativeness was underscored to define a sequence of events rather than separate events.

Based on antenatal fetal imaging, the liver was in its thorax, the left lung was not visible, the right lung measured 1.95 × 1.67 cm and the lung-to-head ratio (LHR) was 1.275 (observed/expected LHR 29–33% [,], qualitative lung index/QLI 0.499), and percent predicted lung volume (PPLV) on fetal MRI was 20.5, all of which indicated poor prognosis []. Additionally, the fetal echocardiogram was suggestive of hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS). The prenatal screening included amniocentesis with 46 XX karyotype and normal alpha-fetoprotein levels. The pregnancy was also complicated by polyhydramnios.\\nAn appropriate-for-gestational-age female infant was delivered by emergent cesarean section for fetal bradycardia after initial induction of labor at 39 weeks gestation. At delivery, she was apneic and floppy, and immediate cord clamping was performed. Her airway was intubated one min after birth, and a Replogle tube was placed to decompress her stomach. Her Apgar scores were 2, 5 and 8 at 1, 5 and 10 min, respectively. Her initial neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) course included gentle mechanical ventilation, followed by bedside surgical repair of CDH two weeks after birth. A postnatal echocardiogram confirmed small left-sided cardiac structures. She also had pulmonary hypertension (PHT) with supra-systemic pulmonary pressures that were managed with inhaled nitric oxide (iNO), milrinone infusion and sildenafil. She required a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) for parenteral nutrition and a gastrostomy tube placement to allow enteral feeding. Her respiratory support was gradually weaned to low flow nasal cannula at 0.5 L/min with 100% O2, received Palivizumab and was continued on oral sildenafil for mild residual PHT. Her microarray was normal. She was discharged home (located at a higher altitude) at 2.5 months of age, only to be readmitted two days later when she presented to the local emergency room with fussiness and emesis and developed respiratory failure, requiring endotracheal intubation. Her brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) was elevated at 4650 pg/mL and was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertensive crisis.\\nDuring her second hospitalization in the NICU, she was extubated to nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) within three days after management with high settings on high-frequency oscillatory ventilation and iNO for hypoxic respiratory failure and PHT. However, she did not tolerate further wean in respiratory support, owing to worsening PHT. She had multiple episodes of PHT crisis with hypoxia and hypercarbia. To assess the V/Q status in her lungs, a nuclear medicine scintigraphy scan was performed at four months of age that showed 10% perfusion to the left lung in comparison to 90% to the right lung. A chest CT scan confirmed hypoplastic left lung. Cardiac catheterization at five months demonstrated worsening PHT, and she was restarted on iNO. Flexible bronchoscopy at five months showed gross narrowing of left mainstem bronchus and lobar bronchi. Due to continued PHT crises and an inability to remain extubated, she underwent a tracheostomy at 5.5 months. She had a BroviacTM (CR Bard, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) catheter placed for central venous access. She received several courses of dexamethasone, with minimal change in her respiratory status.\\nAt six months of age, the under-perfused left lung was emphysematous with a hyperinflated left lower lobe that caused a mediastinal shift to the right side (a). This led to compression of the right lung, further compromising gas exchange. At this stage, due to the futility of all efforts to improve her hypoxic respiratory failure and the severe ventilation/perfusion mismatch (V/Q mismatch) in her left lung, a multidisciplinary discussion involving cardiology, pediatric surgery, pulmonology and neonatology was held to determine the next steps in her management. A trial on different ventilator modalities with higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) and another course of dexamethasone did not result in any improvement (b). Given her labile nature with significant PHT and oxygenation concerns, there was concern if she would benefit from a lobectomy given the high risk of a procedure.\\nA decision was made to trial left main bronchial plugging by placing an inflatable 5Fr bronchial blocker to determine if improving V/Q mismatch by allowing better ventilation of the better perfused right lung segments may facilitate a decrease in respiratory support. We used two separate portable video laryngoscopes (VL), one equipped with a miller 1 blade and the other with a flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope (FFB). A 5 Fr Uniblocker (Fuji Systems, Tokyo, Japan) was guided through the glottic opening under visualization by the miller 1 blade VL. The bronchial blocker was guided into its final position and the balloon was inflated with the help of FFB. The position of the bronchial blocker was confirmed by a chest radiograph (a,b).\\nThe left bronchial blocker placement resulted in an immediate improvement of her respiratory status with a decrease in oxygen requirement and improved ventilation with weaning of ventilator settings, and better inflation of the right lung (a,b). The adverse effects of the bronchial blocker placement included displacement, which required replacement under visualization by anesthesiology. Therefore, surgical exploration was subsequently performed by anterolateral thoracotomy, 80% of the emphysematous left upper lobe was resected (), a small area of the left pulmonary sequestration was also identified and a chest tube was placed.

Physical examination revealed right-sided abdominal tenderness. Laboratory examination revealed slightly higher bilirubin levels (0.4 mg/dL), but serum amylase and lipase levels, and complete blood count were all within the normal range. Abdominal computed tomography demonstrated a large cystic mass in the head of the pancreas, which measured 8.1 × 7.5 × 7.4 cm, and dilatation of the common bile duct, measuring 22 mm in diameter. There was also dilatation of the pancreatic duct, measuring 5 mm in diameter. The remainder of the pancreas was grossly unremarkable. Fine needle aspiration (FNA) was performed using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS). The EUS FNA fluid test showed a CEA level > 900 ng/mL, and fluid cytology was negative for malignancy or high-grade dysplasia. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was performed with biliary stent placement, which led to the resolution of his jaundice. An extended pylorus-sparing pancreaticoduodenectomy was performed. The operation was uneventful, and the patient was discharged 4 days after surgery.\\nGross examination: The pancreatic head was entirely replaced by a mass lesion measuring 8.2 × 7.9 × 7.2 cm and was a unilocular cystic lesion containing gray-green turbid fluid with granular material. The cyst structure appeared to communicate with both the main and side duct branches. The cyst lining was gray-green to yellow, trabecular, and glistening to granular with few fibrous strands that arborized through the cystic structure and anchored at opposing sides of the cyst. Using a standard pancreatic cancer sampling protocol, paraffin-embedded sections of formalin-fixed tissue were studied by routine histology at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory.\\nMicroscopic examination: Histologically, the tumor showed two components composed of an epithelial component and a spindle cell component that were intimately intermingled together. The epithelial component had features ranging from well differentiated to moderately and poorly differentiated pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. The majority of the epithelial component was well differentiated with simple small to large ductal structures lined by a single layer of columnar to cuboidal cells, which had small and basally located nuclei with smooth and round nuclear contours and open chromatin. They had a moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm without mucinous content (). The moderately differentiated component showed a more complex glandular structure with convoluted and interconnected ducts with a single layer of cells or a cribriform-type structure including multiple layers of cells with enlarged and irregular nuclei (). Some areas showed prototypical morphology of conventional pancreatic ductal carcinoma with small and angulated ducts infiltrating the desmoplastic stroma. The poorly differentiated epithelial component was small and focal. It showed vague and poorly formed ductal structures, or solid nests to small sheets of dispersed epithelioid cells with no ductal structures (). These cells had enlarged vesicular nuclei with irregular nuclear contours and conspicuous nucleoli. The spindle cell component was highly cellular with compact spindle cells, which showed hyperchromatic and elongated nuclei with scant cytoplasm. There was rare mitosis in the epithelial component, but the spindle cell component showed frequent mitosis with up to 12 mitoses per 10 high-power fields. Frequent apoptosis was also observed in spindle cell areas. Scattered necrotic areas were present in both components. There were no osteoclast-like giant cells or rhabdomyoblasts and no osteoid formation. There were foci of hemosiderin deposition, especially in the spindle cell areas surrounding the cystic lining. None of the ducts showed papillary or mucinous features. No areas subjacent to the epithelial component showed ovarian stroma-like features. All margins were negative for tumor. Twenty lymph nodes were present, all of which were negative for metastatic tumors. The pathologic staging was pT3pN0.\\nImmunohistochemistry: Extensive immunohistochemical studies were performed at the Indiana University Pathology Laboratory due to the mixed features of the lesion (). The epithelial component was positive for markers of pancytokeratin AE1/AE3, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), CK7, and CK19, and negative for MUC2, MUC5, MUC6, synaptophysin, and chromogranin. Spindle cells were negative for these markers. The spindle cells were diffusely positive for vimentin and DOG1 with patchy positivity for S100. Both epithelial and spindle tumor cells were negative for the estrogen receptor, CD10, inhibin, TLE1, SOX10, Melan A, HMB45, actin, desmin, myogenin, MyoD1, STAT6, and CD117. No nuclear staining was observed for β-catenin. CD163 highlighted cells with hemosiderin deposition, consistent with histiocytes. The tumor cells were negative for CD21 and CD35 expression. P53 showed a wild type staining pattern with no complete loss or overexpression in tumor cells of both components. Cyclin D1 showed patchy nuclear staining in the epithelial component but was negative in the spindle cell component. P16 was positive in the spindle cell component but negative in the epithelial component. The spindle cells demonstrated approximately 20% positivity of Ki-67 nuclear staining, while it showed only scant (about 2%) nuclear staining in the epithelial component (). Additional immunohistochemical staining for PDL-1 (SP142), MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 was performed at the Caris Life Science Laboratory (Phoenix, Arizona) and showed negativity (0%) for PDL-1 expression and intact protein expression of MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2.\\nMolecular study: Molecular analysis of the tumor tissue was first performed by Indiana University Molecular Pathology Laboratory and showed that the tumor was microsatellite stable with no mutation in BRAF, KRAS, and NRAS genes. Additionally, the tumor tissue was sent to the Caris Life Science Laboratory (Phoenix, AZ, USA) for next generation sequencing analysis of whole exome sequencing (WES). Direct sequence analysis was performed on genomic DNA using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 sequencers. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) was low and genomic loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was also low, with 10% of the tested genomic segments exhibiting LOH.

However, the results for AXL1, HDAC1, MED12, NOTCH1, PIK3CB, POLD2, PRKACA, PTPN11, TERT, and XRCC1 were indeterminate because of the low coverage of exons in these genes.\\nThe patient was followed up for three months after surgical resection.

ADPKD had been diagnosed by ultrasound in 1998, which was performed because of hypertension and a positive family history for ADPKD. DNA analysis later showed a PKD2 mutation. In 2008, serum creatinine level was 94 μmol/L, with an eGFR of 83 mL/min/1.73m2 as calculated by the CKD-EPI formula []. Total kidney volume (TKV) was 2351 mL, and height adjusted TKV 1292 mL/m, corresponding to MAYO risk class 1D []. Urine showed microalbuminuria (albumin: creatinine ratio 4.75 g/mmol). Pre-tolvaptan, his 24-h urine volume was 1300 mL.\\nIn that same year, tolvaptan was initiated and uptitrated to the maximum dose of 120 mg per day (90/30 mg) within three weeks. After completion of the TEMPO 3:4 trial, tolvaptan was stopped for one month. Thereafter tolvaptan was re-started as part of a compassionate use program. In 2015 this patient developed hypertension despite use of an angiotensin II receptor blocker (losartan 100 mg q.d.) and a beta-blocker (metoprolol 100 mg b.i.d.). Previously an alpha-blocker and a calcium antagonist had led to intolerable side-effects. Therefore HCT was started at a dose of 12.5 mg q.d. that was well-tolerated, and was later increased to 25 mg q.d.\\nUrinary volumes before and during tolvaptan treatment are shown in Fig. . In 2011, this patient collected 24-h urine once during the month in which tolvaptan was temporarily stopped. At that time urine volume was 1280 mL and urine osmolality 632 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume (based on five measurements) on tolvaptan before HCT initiation was 4867 mL, mean urine osmolality was 212 mOsm/kg (range 164–250 mOsm/kg). After initiation of HCT (12.5 mg q.d.) 24-h urine production declined to 2878 mL, while urine osmolality increased to 290 mOsm/kg. After the increase of HCT to 25 mg q.d. the last 24-h urine collection measured 2699 mL and 280 mOsm/kg. Mean 24-h urine volume had declined during HCT co-treatment by 2078 mL (43%).\\n24-h creatinine excretion was used to verify whether urine collections were complete, assuming unchanged muscle mass over time creatinine excretion should be similar between urine collections. Mean 24-h creatinine excretion before start of HCT was 18.1 mmol/24 h, and after start of HCT 16.7 mmol/24 h, indicating no difference in urine collected.\\nDuring the nine-year treatment period, serum electrolytes were measured 37 times and stayed within the normal range during the whole period. These electrolytes include potassium (range 3.9–4.6 mmol/L), sodium (range 136–144 mmol/L) and calcium (range 2.34–2.57 mmol/L). There were no differences in average electrolyte concentration between the period with tolvaptan monotherapy and the period with tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy.\\neGFR declined from 83 mL/min/1.73m2 in 2008 to 57 mL/min/1.73m2 in 2017 (Fig. ). While on tolvaptan monotherapy the slope of eGFR decline was − 1.35 mL/min/1.73m2 per year, whereas this was − 3.97 mL/minute/1.73m2 per year while on tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy.\\nCopeptin, a surrogate marker of vasopressin [], was measured a total of five times, all in a fasting state around the same time in the morning. In the three years on tolvaptan monotherapy it was measured twice, with values of 24.4 and 20.5 pmol/L. In the month the patient temporarily stopped using tolvaptan, copeptin dropped to 11.1 pmol/L. Thereafter, tolvaptan was reinitiated and copeptin increased to 23.3 pmol/L. Copeptin was highest during tolvaptan-HCT combination therapy: 29.7 pmol/L.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1. The most likely diagnosis.\n2.

The patient’s medical history included smoking, family history of early coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia, percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty to the left descending artery (LAD) and to the right coronary artery (RCA) 12 years earlier, and myocardial infarction 11 years earlier due to in-stent stenosis. In his past medical history, there was an unclear history of sensory or motor impairment after coccyx cyst surgery.\\nAll laboratory data were within normal limits except for the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (521st, 1 132nd) and a C-reactive protein (CRP) > 2 mg/l. Echocardiographic findings were left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 45% and mild left ventricular hypertrophy. Coronary artery CT-angiography was performed and stenosis of three coronary arteries was established.\\nThe induction of anaesthesia was performed with Dormicum 5 mg, Propofol 150 mg, Esmeron 60 mg and Sevoflurane. The patient underwent triple coronary artery bypass grafting as follows: left internal mammary to left anterior descending artery (LIMA–LAD), a saphenous vein graft to the first obtuse marginalis (SVG–OM1) and another saphenous vein graft to the right coronary artery (SVG–RCA). During surgery his vital signs were stable and the arterial blood gasses (ABGs) were within normal limits.\\nAfter surgery the patient was moved to the cardiac ICU while intubated and unconscious, with a blood pressure of 110/60 mmHg, heart rate of 77 beats/min and normal sinus rhythm, central venous pressure of 8 cm H2O and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation of 100%. After admission to the ICU, his primary vital signs were normal. The patient was successfully weaned and extubated on the same day. The post-surgery drugs were: enoxaparin 40 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg daily, metoprolol 100 mg twice daily, clopidogrel 75 mg daily, atorvastatin 20 mg daily and acetylsalicylic acid 100 mg daily.\\nOn the first postoperative day, laboratory findings in the ICU were: haemoglobin 10 g/dl, haematocrit 30.5%, platelets = 242 000 cells/l, white blood cell count = 9 100 cells/l, prothrombin time = 15.3 sec, activated partial thromboplastin time = 32 sec, INR = 1.47, sodium = 139 mEq/l, potassium = 4.9 mmol/l, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) = 17 mg/dl, creatinine = 0.94 mg/dl, creatine phosphokinase (CK) = 847 U/l, CK-MB = 58 U/l. He was moved to the cardiac surgery department. During this first postoperative day, the patient was stable, awake and oriented.

Cognitive functions further deteriorated from baseline MMSE score of 25 to 14 in 3 years, and the patient gradually became fully dependent in daily life. He also developed bladder and bowel incontinence and gait apraxia at the age of 62. In parallel, brain MRI showed evolution of findings: communicating hydrocephalus and leukoencephalopathy were progressing over time (HI was equal to 82, the width of the third ventricle was equal to 11 mm, Fazekas scale score 3), and new lacunar ischemic lesions and hemosiderin deposits appeared ().\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1.

{"uid": "6016175-1", "pmid": "29992067", "title": "Severe Postpartum Hemorrhage Complicated with Liver Infarction Resulting in Hepatic Failure Necessitating Liver Transplantation", "patient": "A 30-year-old woman was transferred to our emergency department five hours after delivering her baby at a clinic. She was a primipara at 41 weeks of gestation. She delivered a baby with vertex presentation vaginally, without dystocia. Massive vaginal bleeding started 2 hours after delivery. After excluding birth canal laceration and retaining placental tissue, the obstetrician began IV fluid and uterotonic treatment, but the bleeding continued. She was then transferred to our hospital due to PPH. However, when she arrived, she had severe tachycardia (heart rate, 160 bpm) and hypotension (BP, 44/34 mmHg). Her consciousness was clear, but she was agitated. We immediately began transfusion of packed red blood cells (6 units), fresh frozen plasma (4 units), apheresis platelets (2 units), and whole blood (2 units) as we simultaneously examined the patient. Signs of DIC developed with continuous blood loss (), and her consciousness deteriorated within 30 minutes after arriving at the emergency department.\\nUterine atony and an ischemic uterus were found during emergency laparotomy. A subtotal hysterectomy was completed. Intraoperative blood loss was 800 mL. The patient was transferred to the ICU after surgery. Her postoperative fibrinogen level was 54.6 mg/dL (normal: 200–400 mg/dL). We transfused fresh frozen plasma and cryoprecipitate to achieve a fibrinogen level greater than 100 mg/dL. However, unstable blood pressure and progressive abdominal distension were found 4 hours after the primary surgery. We rushed the patient back into surgery due to suspicion of internal bleeding. Hemoperitoneum of 2000 mL and active bleeding from ruptured pararectal vessels were identified. After the secondary surgery for ligation of the bleeding vessels, the patient had acute kidney injury with anuria, intractable hyperkalemia, and metabolic acidosis. Thus she underwent continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH).\\nThe patient's hemodynamic status and ventilation function gradually improved after hemostasis. CVVH was shifted to intermittent hemodialysis on postoperative day 10. She was extubated on the same day.\\nUnfortunately, hyperbilirubinemia progressed and became the main problem (). Liver enzyme levels peaked on postoperative day 3 and then settled to about 100–200 IU/L (). Thrombocytopenia continued, along with prolonged prothrombin time (INR, 1.2–1.5) and activated partial thromboplastin time (1.5–2.5 times of normal control) (). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed no biliary tract obstruction but an ill-defined hypoechoic lesion in the right lobe of the liver, about 6.5 × 6.5 cm, probably due to an inflammatory process or tumor growth. Abdominal CT was indicated to confirm the characteristic of the lesion but was postponed due to the patient's poor renal function. After consultation with a gastrointestinal expert, the lesion was thought to be a liver abscess or focal necrosis due to ischemic change. Her consciousness had been deteriorating since post-PPH day 20 in combination with intractable fever. Brain CT showed no intracranial lesion. Worsening cognition was likely due to metabolic encephalopathy of hepatic or infectious origin.\\nA liver transplantation was indicated, and a pretransplantation CT scan showed poor enhancement of the right hepatic lobe on the periphery covering about 50% of the total area, which was suggestive of liver infarction (). Living donor liver transplantation was performed 28 days after PPH. The donor was her younger brother, and the graft liver weight was 840 gm. The graft-to-recipient weight ratio was 1.24%. Intraoperatively, there were multiple micronodular lesions on the liver surface with marked swelling of the liver parenchyma and diffuse devitalized liver tissue in the right lobe of liver with necrosis and in the left lobe peripheral zone accounting for about 70%–80 % of the total liver volume (Figures and ).\\nThe patient's bilirubin level improved on the first three days but increased again on the 4th day after transplantation. The coagulation parameters did not change significantly after liver transplantation. Serial liver ultrasonography showed acceptable vascular status of the transplanted liver, without thrombosis or biliary obstruction.

An elevated serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) level of 76.2 ng/mL was observed, and digital rectal examination showed diffuse induration of the prostate. Pelvic MRI demonstrated extensive high signal of the prostate in diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) (). Fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT revealed multiple spine and pelvic bone and para-aortic and pelvic lymph node metastases (Figures and ). Based on these findings, the patient was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer (cT3aN1M1b) and treated without prostate needle biopsy, with primary androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), including a GnRH antagonist (degarelix) and anti-androgen agent (bicalutamide). The PSA level immediately declined and reached nadir (0.23 ng/mL) after 8 months. However, 15 months after the start of ADT (PSA level, 2.33 ng/mL), the patient was diagnosed with CRPC and referred to our hospital.\\nTo evaluate the patient's current disease status, we performed CT, bone scan, and WB-MRI. We observed discrepancies between the WB-MRI, bone scan, and CT. CT showed multiple osteoblastic lesions in the spine and pelvic bone (Figures and ) and shrunken para-aortic lymph nodes. Bone scan similarly showed multiple accumulations at the same bone sites as the CT (). However, these osteoblastic lesions showed almost no high signal in DWI of WB-MRI, suggesting that the lesions did not have viable tumor cells (Figures –). In contrast, the primary lesion had a diffuse high signal remaining in DWI of WB-MRI ().\\nWe then performed histopathological examinations of both the prostate and the vertebra.

Meanwhile, we performed the CT-guided needle biopsy from the osteoblastic lesion of the second lumbar vertebra, which was diagnosed with bone metastasis by CT and bone scintigraphy, to exclude vertebral bone metastasis of prostate cancer by an orthopedic unit of another hospital, which the patient visited owing to lumbago and bilateral lower limb paralysis.

Comorbidities included hemochromatosis and a distant history of meningococcal meningitis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain demonstrated a large right parietal lesion. Computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan revealed left upper and lower lobe lung lesions, solitary liver lesion, and base of skull lesion. Histopathology confirmed BRAF/NRAS wild-type metastatic melanoma. He proceeded with resection of the right parietal lobe metastases in February followed by ipilimumab (3 mg/kg)/nivolumab (1 mg/kg) commencing in March ().\\nMRI brain on the April 3 demonstrated intracranial recurrence with PET/CT confirming stable extracranial disease. A redo craniotomy was performed on April 8, complicated by the development of cerebral abscess and ventriculitis requiring burr hole and drainage. Cultures confirmed corynebacterium acnes and he commenced intravenous (IV) Cephalothin for a total of 12 weeks. Six weeks following his last dose of immunotherapy and while on IV antibiotics for his cerebral abscess, the patient developed severe peripheral edema, dyspnea, and tachycardia. Electrocardiograph (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia, left axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. Transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) revealed a new circumferential pericardial effusion with early signs of tamponade. Serial troponins remained normal, and cardiac MRI showed no evidence of myocarditis. A diagnosis of ICI-induced pericarditis with associated pericardial effusion was made. The patient was commenced on aggressive diuresis, colchicine 500 mcg daily and ibuprofen 500 mg three times daily. The active decision to withhold high-dose corticosteroids was made given the patient’s concomitant cerebral abscess. He was monitored with weekly echocardiograms by the treating cardiologist with gradual resolution of the pericardial effusion over 4 weeks. Immunotherapy was discontinued. In June 2020, the patient had a further recurrence of brain metastases. A third resection followed by stereotactic radiosurgery to the cavity were completed at that time.\\nSeven months following cessation of immunotherapy, the patient presented with sudden onset aphasia, left lower limb myoclonic jerks, and confusion. Further history revealed that the patient had developed subtle behavioral changes in the weeks prior. CT brain and angiogram showed no evidence of acute cerebrovascular event, infection, or intracranial disease progression. Laboratory results showed a normal CRP (0.7 m/L) and mild hyponatremia (129 mmol/L). An MRI brain revealed T2/FLAIR hyperintensity in the right mesotemporal lobe with differentials including encephalitis or postictal changes (). Electroencephalogram (EEG) demonstrated lateralizing periodic discharges from the right temporal region. Empirical acyclovir was commenced following a lumbar puncture that demonstrated a mild elevation of protein 0.62 g/L, normal white cell count, negative bacterial/fungal cultures, and negative viral PCR panel. Despite up titration of antiepileptics, the patient continued to deteriorate with increasing confusion, fluctuating level of consciousness, persistent dysphasia, and development of visual hallucinations. Autoimmune encephalitis and antineuronal antibody panels were normal.

He was admitted to a local hospital and was hospitalized with severe hypokalemia (1.9 mmol/L) and metabolic acidosis (pH 7.22, pCO2 26.0 mm Hg, HCO3 10.6 mmol/L, lactate 7.1 mmol/L, base excess −15.6 mmol/L). The patient recovered from paralysis on the third hospital day with serum potassium level 3.1 mmol/L and normal blood gas results after appropriate therapy. He presented to our hospital for further evaluation. Physical examination was only significant for pallor. He did not have a family or personal history of neuromuscular, thyroid, or autoimmune disease.\\nAt the time of admission, laboratory evaluation revealed the following abnormalities: white blood count 3.16 × 109/L, hemoglobin 74 g/L, and platelet count 128 × 109/L. Serum chemistry showed: sodium 140 mmol/L, chloride 108 mmol/L, potassium 3.18 mmol/L, calcium 1.89 mmol/L, creatinine 57.8 mmol/L, and bicarbonate 19 mmol/L. Urinary pH was 6.5, with sodium 80 mmol/L and potassium 18.68 mmol/L; chloride, calcium, and creatinine were normal. A 24-hour urine test started on the day of admission revealed the following: sodium 320 mmol/24 h, potassium 74.7 mmol/24 h, calcium 12.24 mmol/24 h, and protein 988.00 mg/24 h. Serum and urinary osmolality were 303 and 158 mOsm/kg, respectively. Growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor 1, thyroid hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, plasma aldosterone, renin activity, antinuclear antibody, and anti-Smith antibody were within reference range. Other chemistries and coagulation parameters were in normal range.\\nBrain magnetic resonance imaging showed an abnormal pituitary gland, and he had an insignificant response to a water deprivation test after vasopressin injection. The findings suggested NDI. With overt acidosis (plasma bicarbonate <20 mmol/L) and urinary pH > 6.0, we confirmed the coexistence of renal tubular acidosis. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed symmetrical homogeneous kidneys with hyperechogenic pattern and poor corticomedullary differentiation (Fig. ). Because of the hematologic abnormalities, bone marrow aspiration was performed and revealed 39% blast cells. The immunophenotypic analysis showed blast cells positive for CD34+, CD38+, CD10+, CD19+, CD22+, cyCD22+, CD79+, HLA-DR+, and TdT+. Cytogenetics showed normal male karyotype. Cerebrospinal cytology was negative. He was diagnosed with precursor B-cell ALL with acquired NDI. Leukemic infiltration of the kidneys may have led to polydipsia and polyuria.\\nThis patient had an excellent response to standardized combination chemotherapy and achieved complete remission (CR) at the end of induction. His polydipsia and polyuria improved considerably after 3 days of chemotherapy. He refused the best therapy of allogeneic stem-cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) at that time.

Prior to developing the symptoms in her knee, she suffered from loose stools and abdominal pain that had resolved by the time the patient developed pain in her knee. The patient denied any recent trauma, any rashes, or recent travel.\\nPhysical examination was pertinent for tachycardia with a heart rate of 147 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 25 breaths per minute, temperature of 100.5 F, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Blood pressure was 101/59 mmHg. The left knee was red, hot, and swollen. The range of motion of the left knee was restricted. The rest of her physical examination was unremarkable.\\nOn laboratory work up, hemoglobin was 15.2 g/dL (13.5–17.5 g/dL); white blood cell (WBC) count, 14,900 cells/uL (4.5–11 k/uL), total bilirubin, 0.8 mg/dL (0.3–1.0 mg/dL); aspartate aminotransferase, 35 U/L (13–39 U/L); alanine aminotransferase, 33 U/L (4–33 U/L); alkaline phosphatase, 124 U/L (34–104 U/L); s. creatinine, 2.3 mg/dl; and sodium and potassium, within normal limits. Lateral and anterior-posterior view X-rays of the left knee joint showed prior total knee replacement but no other significant findings (Figures and ).\\nThe initial differentials included septic arthritis of her prosthetic knee joint and reactive arthritis after her recent diarrhea. Gout and other rheumatologic conditions were less likely.\\nA preliminary diagnosis of sepsis due to septic arthritis was made, and supportive management with intravenous (IV) fluids, empiric antibiotics (vancomycin and zosyn), and antipyretics was initiated. Arthrocentesis was performed, and purulent fluid was drained. This was sent for Gram staining and cultures. Gram staining was significant for numerous WBCs and Gram-negative coccobacilli. The culture came back the next day growing Gram-positive coccobacilli that were subsequently identified as Yersinia enterocolitis. This was sensitive to all the antibiotics it was tested against. The blood cultures came back positive for Yersinia enterocolitica too. Yersinia enterocolitica was identified as the cause of the septic arthritis, which was likely the cause of her diarrhea prior to presenting.\\nThe patient was seen by orthopedic surgery in consultation and underwent resection of her left TKA and placement of a biodegradable implant without any complications. The patient was also seen by infectious disease in consultation, and based on their recommendations, the patient was discharged home to complete 6 weeks of outpatient IV antibiotics in the form of 2 g of ceftriaxone daily considering her sepsis and prosthetic material in her knee joint.

He complained of frequent falls and leg weakness for 3–4 months. The weakness appeared to be progressive and persistent without episodic worsening. He had to use a cane to compensate but was still able to ambulate. His family members also endorsed cognitive defects over the past few months before admission. These impairments consisted mainly of apathy and withdrawal from social interactions; he used to be fully independent but now stayed at home most of the time. His medical history was only significant for alcohol abuse (three to four cans of beer and red wine daily for 2 years), and his family history was unremarkable.\\nPhysical examinations showed an age-appropriate, alert, and oriented man. He was able to engage in conversations with a paucity of speech and flat affect; he also made eye contact and followed all commands during our evaluations.\\nThere was bilateral weakness with spasticity in all lower extremity muscle groups. The deep tendon reflex was hypoactive with an upward response of the plantar reflex on the left side. He also had a wide-based unsteady gait and poor limb coordination. The remainder of the neurological examination and a general examination were unremarkable.\\nInitial brain computed tomography (CT) in our emergency room demonstrated a mass lesion occupying the left caudate and extending into his frontal lobe (Fig. ). A brain MRI showed bilateral and symmetric hyperintense signals in the corpus callosum, periventricular white matter, and internal capsule (Fig. ) with an axial fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence with gadolinium enhancement (Fig. ). A cervical spine MRI was negative for cord compression and abnormal signals.\\nRoutine blood tests, as well as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), syphilis, and thyroid function tests, were unremarkable, and his serum vitamin B12 level was borderline (289 picogram per milliliter). A cerebral spinal fluid sample revealed a mildly elevated protein level (120 mg per deciliter) with a normal cell count (two cells per milliliter) and glucose level (79 mg per deciliter). The sample was negative for cytology, oligoclonal bands, culture, and Epstein–Barr virus DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR). His urine toxicology panel was negative for common recreational drugs.\\nThe initial impression was an acquired demyelinating white matter disease due to nutritional deficiency. A trial vitamin supplement (500 mg administered intravenously three times a day and 1000 μg of cyanocobalamin administered intramuscularly daily) was given based on his alcohol abuse history, but no symptom improvements were seen during the following week. An inherited condition was thus suspected given the negative workup, the non-response to treatment, and the symmetric involvement in the brain MRI. This suspicion was validated by his peroxisomal fatty acid profile (Table ), and a diagnosis of X-ALD was confirmed according to the identification of a pathogenic mutation in the ABCD1 gene: c.1489 2A>G (g.153005544). Adrenocortical insufficiency was not identified during the evaluation. No seizure activity was witnessed or shown on video-electroencephalography.\\nHis neurological condition deteriorated rapidly. He progressed into a non-verbal, quadriplegic patient dependent on a ventilator within 5 months of the initial encounter, and after 1 year of follow up he had degenerated into a vegetative state.

Past medical history included previous breast cancer post-lumpectomy and radiotherapy, remote history of vulvar and rectal cancer post wide-debulking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and ventilator-dependent respiratory failure with tracheostomy. Home medications included albuterol/ipratropium nebulizer, alprazolam, amlodipine, aripiprazole, budesonide/formoterol metered dose inhaler, citalopram, tamoxifen, tiotropium inhaler, trazodone, and oxycodone. She reported an allergy to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient initially presented to another facility complaining of fever, diarrhea, shortness of breath, and increasing oxygen demands. On examination, the patient was not in acute distress. All systems were negative except for diminished lung sounds with rhonchi bilaterally. A chest X-ray demonstrated left upper lobe pneumonia. Blood cultures were drawn, and a sample of tracheostomy secretions was sent for culture and sensitivities. She was initiated on vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for treatment of healthcare-associated pneumonia. The patient reported a history of Clostridium difficile colitis and was started on oral vancomycin and IV metronidazole. On day 2, a bronchoscopy was performed with washings sent for culture. Both respiratory cultures grew MDRPA while blood cultures remained negative. The susceptibility profile is outlined in Table . Piperacillin-tazobactam was switched to meropenem at 2 g IV every 8 hours, and inhaled tobramycin was added. A repeat bronchoscopy was performed on day 12 due to mucus plugging and lack of clinical response. This culture grew persistent MDRPA, necessitating the addition of IV tobramycin on day 16. Inhaled tobramycin was switched to inhaled colistin on day 20. On day 23, tobramycin IV and metronidazole were discontinued and the meropenem dose was decreased.\\nOn day 24, a 12-French chest tube was successfully placed into the left upper lobe abscess. Approximately 30 mL of purulent material was aspirated and sent for culture. Growth from this drainage continued to demonstrate MDRPA. One day after chest tube insertion, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest demonstrated significantly diminished fluid component of the left upper lobe abscess with drain positioned in the air-containing component; residual left upper lobe and left lingular pneumonia and pulmonary emphysema was also noted. The patient failed to improve and on day 28 ceftolozane-tazobactam was initiated at 1.5 g IV every 8 hours. A repeat chest CT scan on day 30 showed a decrease in the left upper gas-fluid collection, but persistent dense pneumonia of the left upper lung and a new smaller infiltrate in the left lower lobe.\\nTwo days after the repeat chest CT, the patient was transferred to our facility for worsening pneumonia, requiring a higher level of care and CTS consultation. Abnormal clinical examination findings included diffusely diminished lung sounds, rales in the left lower lobe, a left pigtail chest tube drain, tachycardia with heart rate of 120 beats per minute, and tachypnea with a respiratory rate of 22 breaths per minute. The patient's chest tube was intact with a small amount of thick, white drainage, which was sent for culture, along with 2 sets of blood cultures. Ceftolozane-tazobactam 1.5 g IV every 8 hours was continued, and meropenem was stopped. The patient was initiated on tobramycin 280 mg (7 mg/kg) IV every 24 hours.

In addition, a small non-obstructing stone in the right renal pelvis was seen, suggesting a chronic ureteropelvic junction stricture. Preoperative laboratory results showed a white blood cell count of 10.4x10^3 cells/µL.\\nPre-operative diagnosis\\nBased on the patient’s history of present illness and associated investigations the preoperative diagnosis was chronic appendicitis.\\nTreatment\\nLaparoscopic appendectomy was performed on the patient. The appendix was identified and found to be chronically scarred and chronically inflamed in appearance. The mesoappendix was taken down with Sonicision, the base transected with Endo-GIA, and delivered from the peritoneal cavity in an Endobag and sent to pathology.\\nPost-operative diagnosis\\nThe post-operative diagnosis was chronic appendicitis.\\nOutcome/progress\\nAfter recovering from anesthesia, the patient was discharged home on the same day as his procedure with no complaints and is currently being followed in an outpatient setting. The patient continues to report complete resolution of his symptoms. Postoperative histopathology report on the specimen taken from the patient (Figure ) showed chronic lymphoplasmacytic inflammation with associated histiocytes and granulation tissue, further supporting the diagnosis of chronic appendicitis.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1.

Her mother had end-stage breast cancer. We visited her house regularly to care for her mother. The woman with ASD was the main caregiver and a key person for her mother because her father was visually impaired. There were some obstacles we need to overcome together, but in the end, she was able to fulfill the role of the main caregiver for her mother.\\nWhen we started home care for the mother, we did not have any knowledge that the daughter was a person with ASD. However, we occasionally heard about her from home visit nurses and home care staff because they worried about whether the mother could continue to stay at home due to the lack of care provided by family members. According to home care staff members, the woman with ASD was usually not present when the home care staff visited the home for her mother's care. They could not contact her or talk with her about her mother's condition. She focused on dishwashing and did not appear concerned about how her mother's medications or clothes were organized or whether the room was clean or not. She could not communicate well with home care staff even when she talked with them. Thus, we did not initially recognize that she was a person with ASD or another developmental disorder. We were wondering why she was having trouble managing the home care schedule and chores even though she worked as an engineer. The home care staff's distrust of the daughter caused irritation and stress in the daughter and the home care staff.\\nAfter a few home care visits, with the daughter's consent, the mother's care manager informed us that she had been diagnosed with ASD in adulthood. Her parents had not been informed of the diagnosis. The daughter did not want to let her parents know about the diagnosis. The home care staff started to feel strongly that it was too difficult for the daughter to continue home care for the mother. The woman with ASD also felt difficulties in communicating with staff and understanding how her mother felt or how it feels to be severely ill. Therefore, we initiated consultation and social skill training in our outpatient clinic for the daughter. We discussed the traits of ASD as well as solutions or strategies to manage ASD traits in the home care setting. When we gave her instructions, we tried to make them more specific and provided examples so that she could understand them easily. For example, we suggested that she needed to come into her mother's room to share her mother's condition when the home care staff made a visit.\\nAfter several consultations, she gradually obtained life skills in communication, scheduling, and managing things related to home care, such as expectations during home care staff visits or what she should do for her mother. Her psychological stress and caregiving burden decreased day by day. We also shared the fact that she was diagnosed with ASD with home care staff as well as appropriate attitudes, support, and communication styles. We shared her behavioral characteristics with staff, such as lower interest in sharing emotions with others or having difficulties in understanding social cues such as eye contact, facial expressions, and metaphors.\\nFive months after the start of home-based care, her mother's condition worsened temporarily. The woman with ASD could not understand her mother's discomfort or pain and her father's sadness and serious feelings about the poor prognosis of his wife. She could not understand why her father was at a loss for words upon hearing the doctor's explanation of her mother's severe condition. Therefore, she asked him “Didn't you hear, Dad?” in a loud voice. These types of reactions by the daughter interfered with her father's acceptance of her mother's condition and he was unable to continue to listen the explanation.

He was initially treated with radiation therapy alone, but later transitioned to chemotherapy [initially with MOPP (mechlorethamine, vincristine, procarbazine, and prednisone) and later converted to ABVD (doxorubicin, bleomycin, vinblastine, and dacarbazine)] with remission achieved 1 year later. At age 24, he developed sudden onset left-sided persistent numbness followed by bilateral sensorineural hearing loss with near complete left-sided deafness. At age 26, he presented with bright red blood in his stool, which required resection of 6 inches of small intestines for reasons that were unclear. By age 29, he developed heart failure and pulmonary hypertension presumed secondary to ABVD treatment. His history was also significant for superior vena cava occlusion, presumed secondary to a port catheter, and esophageal varices. Immunologic evaluation revealed normal immunoglobulins, lymphocyte proliferation to mitogens, and lymphocyte subsets except for a slightly low CD8 count (83/μl).

The patient had no neurologic abnormalities, except for headache. An initial non-contrast brain computed tomography (CT) scan showed a scanty subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) on the left ambient cistern with an enlarged ventricle (Fig. A). Subsequent brain CT angiography (CTA) showed no vascular abnormalities.

After a right femoral artery puncture, the left vertebral artery (VA) was not visible on left subclavian angiography; therefore, a 6-Fr soft, torqueable catheter optimized for intracranial access (SOFIA; MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA) was advanced into the V4 segment of the right VA under roadmap guidance. Subsequently, we attempted to reach the Headway 17 microcatheter (MicroVention Terumo, Tustin, CA) into the aneurysmal sac, but it failed due to the acute angle of the vertebra–PICA junction. Therefore, after deploying the coil in the VA just before the PICA origin, we planned to position the microcatheter in the PICA with the support of the coil mass (Fig. B). However, some of the coil masses deployed to the VA migrated upward of the PICA origin unintentionally during the navigation process using a microwire and microcatheter (Fig. C). Therefore, we additionally deployed a coil to the VA and finished the procedure after confirming PICA occlusion (Fig. D). Fortunately, with supportive care in an intensive care unit after the procedure, the patient recovered fully, and follow-up magnetic resonance imaging showed no definitive acute cerebral infarction in the PICA territory. One year after embolization, a follow-up angiography was performed, which revealed recanalization of the right PICA with normal arterial configuration, and no aneurysmal sacs were observed in the distal PICA. The recanalized VA was located medial to the deployed coil mass (Fig. E).\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1. The most likely diagnosis.\n2.

The patient also complained of low-grade fever and unilateral pain in breast tissue. The general physical examination showed a one-centimeter erythematous and tender mass in the right breast tissue. There was no nipple discharge, axillary lymphadenopathy, or external draining sinuses. The primary care physician evaluated the patient and called for a USG for the assessment of the affected breast, which demonstrated an ill-defined lesion with thin fluid streaks in the lower outer quadrant, suggesting an inflammatory lesion (Figure ).\\nAt the same time, cystic fluid from her breast was aspirated, and the bacterial culture test showed no growth of any microorganisms after 48 hours. The cytology revealed predominantly neutrophils and degenerating cells in a hemorrhagic background, which suggested an acute suppurative inflammatory process of the affected breast as shown in Figure .\\nBased on the clinical features, imaging findings, and cytology reports, a presumptive diagnosis of acute mastitis with underlying bacterial abscess was established. Subsequently, she was being prescribed a course of antibiotics and antipyretics for one week. However, instead of improving, her condition worsened over time. Therefore, the physician decided to repeat the ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration and cytology (FNAC). The sonomammogram of the right breast revealed an ill-demarcated hypoechoic irregular lesion involving the parenchyma of the right breast in the outer lower and adjoining upper quadrants. The lesion measured 34.4 millimeters on a long axis with no fluid components as shown in Figure .\\nThe repeated cytological examination also showed cellular clusters comprising histiocytes and epithelioid-like cells. Hence, based on these findings, the treating physician concluded that the ongoing clinical picture was more suggestive of tuberculosis of the breast. Therefore, after discussing with the patient, a therapeutic trial of an anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT) was prescribed for four weeks. However, instead of any clinical improvement, her condition worsened over time and she had to visit her physician again just after three weeks. Her re-assessment by sonomammography was performed, which indicated an ill-demarcated hypoechoic irregular lesion, measuring 44.7×35.4 millimeters in the outer lower and adjoining upper quadrants of the right breast with thin fluid streaks as shown in Figure .\\nThe sonologist concluded that these findings were consistent with an infectious or inflammatory lesion. Afterward, the primary care physician referred her to a teaching hospital for a surgical consult. So, re-evaluation of the patient was performed by a detailed history, thorough general physical examination, and routine laboratory investigations. It was then planned to perform incision and drainage of pus collection and excisional tissue biopsy after surgical resection of the mass. The excisional biopsy material was sent for histopathology and pussy discharge for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear. After surgery, she received broad-spectrum antibiotics (ceftriaxone and moxifloxacin) for two weeks. The subsequent histopathology showed areas of acute and chronic inflammation along with predominant lobulocentric granulomatous inflammation as shown in Figure .\\nThese findings were suggestive of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis as an etiology. Concurrently, the AFB smear also came out to be negative. Hence, a final diagnosis of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis was established. Afterward, corticosteroids (prednisolone) were also added to the drug dosage regimen of this patient. The patient was followed up after one month, and during this period her symptoms had started to resolve. The medical team agreed to advise her to follow up until the complete resolution of her disease, and she was followed up monthly for the next three months. During these follow-up visits, we evaluated the patient for improvement in the clinical symptoms.

Sentinel lymph node biopsy was negative for neoplasm. Immunohistochemical stains for Melan-A and HMB-45 were diffusely reactive and -catenin showed non-specific cytoplasmic staining. Ki-67 demonstrated a low proliferative index (<5% in tumor cells). Four-color in situ hybridization was performed to rule out melanoma which showed normal results.

In addition, circumferential wall thickening of the parent carotid artery was seen on T2WI immediately proximally (Figure ) and distally to the aneurysm (Figure ), with a corresponding concentric narrowing of its lumen visible on MRA. Endoscopic sinus surgery was performed with removal of mucus and fungal debris, which was confirmed as aspergilloma on pathologic examination. The diagnosis was made of a mycotic aneurysm of the intracavernous carotid artery resulting from local spread of invasive aspergillosis from the adjacent sphenoid sinus, secondary to an immunosuppressive status resulting from chemotherapy and longstanding systemic corticosteroid treatment. Because of the dismal prognosis of the malignancy and contraindication of antiaggregative drugs for reasons of a single hemorrhagic metastasis in the right cerebellar hemisphere, the multidisciplinary decision was made to refrain from endovascular treatment. The patient died a few weeks later.\n\nTask: Based on this clinical presentation, provide:\n1. The most likely diagnosis.\n2. Two alternative differential diagnoses.\n3.
